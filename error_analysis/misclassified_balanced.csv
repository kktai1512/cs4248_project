1,"North Koreas official news agency announced today that the militarys planned missile test had been put on hold because of problems with Windows 8. Intelligence analysts said that the announcement gave rare insight into the inner workings of North Koreas missile program, which until last year had been running on Windows 95. The announcement from the Korean Central News Agency (KCNA) did not indicate a new scheduled time for a missile test, saying only that it was working with Windows 8 support to resolve the issue. In the words of one intelligence analyst, That means the test has been delayed indefinitely. A source close to the North Korean regime reported that Supreme Leader Kim Jong-un is furious about the Windows 8 problems and is considering a number of options, including declaring war on Microsoft.

1,"Republican lawmakers asked increasingly tough questions today as they held another day of hearings to investigate, in the words of Rep. Darrell Issa (R-California), Hillary Clintons suspiciously high poll numbers and what can be done to make them lower. With the help of Fox News, we have brutally attacked Hillary Clinton for months, and yet she remains more popular than ever, Rep. Issa said. This committee needs to know how that happened, and how we can keep it from happening in the future. Rep. Issa pointed to recent polls showing the former Secretary of State trouncing every potential G.O.P. Presidential candidate, even a skinnier version of Chris Christie. We demand an answer to one simple question, he said. What does Secretary Clinton know that none of us knows? In his boldest allegation of the day, Rep. Issa accused Secretary Clinton of cynically using her post as Secretary of State to become wildly popular with the American people. I invite her to these hearings to answer those charges, he said. Wrapping up for the day, Rep. Issa warned the former Secretary of State that he was just getting started: Once we Republicans decide to investigate someone, we dont stop. If Secretary Clinton doesnt believe me, she should ask her husband. ",2
1," In a positive development for the U.S.-led campaign of air strikes in Syria, a new poll indicates strong, broad-based support for the mission among people who have yet to read a news article about Syria. According to the poll, released on Tuesday, the bombing campaign got a thumbs-up from people who had no information about Syrias civil war, including its duration, the parties involved, and what a Sunni is. Additionally, the air strikes garnered enthusiastic support from people who could not correctly identify the President of Syria, tell what the acronym ISIS stands for, or locate Syria on a map. According to pollster Davis Logsdon, who supervised the survey for the University of Minnesotas Opinion Research Institute, the poll numbers augur well for the mission going forward. People who have not read a single article about Syria are a key constituency because they represent an overwhelming majority of Americans, he said. And when you asked the follow-up question of whether they intended to read an article about Syria in the future, their answer was a resounding no. According to Logsdon, the bombing campaign also earned high marks from another important group, Americans who think that they maybe read a news headline about Syria but did not click on it. ",3
1,"As preparations get under way for the first Republican Presidential debate, on Thursday night, a new poll shows that Americans are deeply concerned that the rest of the world might see it. According to the poll, there is widespread fear that, if the debate were to be viewed in foreign countries, the cost to the United States prestige around the world would be incalculable. On a more personal level, many expressed concern that any international broadcast of the debate would greatly diminish their desire to ever travel abroad or talk to foreigners. In another measure of Americans discomfort with Thursdays televised event, two of the TV programs they identified as being the biggest embarrassments to America, Duck Dynasty and Jersey Shore, still lagged far behind the debate. Those surveyed strongly agreed that the U.S. government should block the foreign transmission of the debate, or that Fox News should air an explanation of the contest beforehand, but they were at a loss as to what that explanation could possibly be. And, in a result that seemed to sum up Americans anxiety, a broad majority agreed with the statement God, this is so embarrassing. ",2
1," Today, American International Group (A.I.G.) issued the following letter to American taxpayers. Dear American Taxpayers: In 2008, you paid for a bailout of A.I.G. totalling $182 billion. Today, we are writing to tell you that were thinking of suing you. When we made this decision, we knew we were in for some rough treatment from the media. Weve been called everything from soulless bloodsuckers to Satans scabrous handmaidens, and worse. At A.I.G., though, we have a different name for ourselves: true American heroes. You see, by suing the same people who bailed out our asses just five years ago, we are standing up for one of the most precious American rights of all: the right to sue someone who has just saved your life. Lets say that youre trapped in a burning building and a fireman pulls you out to safety. Once youre out of the fire, though, you notice that the fireman carelessly ripped the lapel of your Armani jacket. Shouldnt you be able to sue the fireman for the full cost of its replacement? Or lets say youre drowning in the ocean. A lifeguard dives in, pulls you back onto the shore, and administers mouth-to-mouth resuscitation. Arent you entitled to take appropriate actioni.e., sue him for sexual harassment? By suing you, we are standing up for the right of every other American who might, through no fault of his own, have his life saved and want to sue the person who saved him for millions of dollars. And thats why were asking for your help today. Lawsuits arent cheap. They require highly paid lawyers, who rack up millions in legal fees, not to mention first-class airfare, hotels, and sumptuous gourmet mealshardly the kind of expense that we at A.I.G. can afford. Thats why wed like you to pay for it. You may think were expecting a lot, asking you for the money necessary for us to sue you. But, remember, theres a bigger principle at stake, and someday, if youre pulled from a burning building or an ocean, youll be glad you stood with us today. Oh, and as for our ad campaign, Thank you, America? Were sticking with that, just changing the first word. See you in court, Your friends at A.I.G. ",2
1,"In the first term in office, President Barack Obama has broken with a tradition established over the previous eight years through his controversial use of complete sentences, political observers say. New polls indicate that millions of Americans are put off by the Presidents unorthodox verbal tic, which has Mr. Obama employing grammatically correct sentences virtually every time he opens his mouth. Mr. Obamas decision to use complete sentences in his public pronouncements, as well as his insistence on the correct pronunciation of the word nuclear, has harmed his relection hopes among millions of voters who find his unusual speaking style unfamiliar and bizarre. According to Presidential historian Davis Logsdon, of the University of Minnesota, after eight years of George W. Bush many Americans find it alienating to have a President who speaks English as if it were his first language. Every time Obama opens his mouth, his subjects and verbs are in agreement, says Mr. Logsdon. If he keeps it up, he is running the risk of sounding like an litist. The historian said that if Mr. Obama insists on using complete sentences in his speeches, on Election Day the public may find itself saying, O.K., subject, predicate, subject predicatewe get it, stop showing off. Elsewhere, consumers who believed that Nutella was nutritious have won a $3.05 million lawsuit, the highest award ever paid to morons. ",2
1,"Oof. This may be a tough one for fans to hear, but the film world was dealt a harsh dose of truth yesterday when action star Jason Statham admitted that he did all his own stunts and has been doing so for the majority of his career. Though rumors have swirled for years, the 48-year-old English actor had never addressed them head-on until a press conference yesterday, where a visibly emotional Statham struggled to deliver his prepared statement. It was all me: I drove the car on top of the train in The Transporter; I fought the guy on the helicopter in Crank, said Statham, who was flanked by family members and representatives. For years Ive kept this hidden from audiences, but I hope I can repair the damage Ive done by admitting now that I did those stunts. Snatch; Death Race; The Expendables. It was me every time. Wow. However you feel now about the Furious 7 star, you have to admit it takes guts to lay it all out like that. Stathams fans have been weighing in ever since his announcement, and the responses run the gamut: Can Jasons star still shine as bright as it did before, or is it dulled for good? Let us know what you think on Facebook and Twitter. ",2
1," Today, former Senator Rick Santorum issued the following letter to the American people. Dear American People: When I think about government-mandated health care, I have the same response that any mature adult would have: it makes me want to throw up. Thats why, on my first day as President, I will repeal Obamacare. Well, actually, on my very first day Im going to repeal the Renaissance. And also the theory of evolution. But I will definitely get rid of Obamacare by Day Three, Four at the latest. You see, Obamacare runs counter to my well-documented position on personal freedom: I believe in the rights of the unborn child, until its born and wants a checkup. What will take the place of Obamacare? As your President, I will institute Santorumcare, a health-care plan that will cover absolutely no medical procedures whatsoever except one: exorcism. For many years, possession by the devil has been Americas No. 1 health problem, far more serious than those posed by cigarette manufacturers who have funneled millions to my PACs. You dont have to take Rick Santorums word for it that America is in the grips of a devil-possession epidemic: just watch any episode of Jersey Shore. Youre probably saying to yourself, Government-mandated exorcisms are a great idea, Rick. But how will we find the devil babies to exorcise? Good question, and I have a good answer: on my first day as President, I will order mandatory transvaginal ultrasounds for every woman in America. These ultrasounds will be a prerequisite to getting a drivers license at the D.M.V., where theres plenty of downtime for such a procedure. Additionally, they can be easily and safely performed by T.S.A. employees on the airport security line. If an ultrasound turns up any telltale signs of a devil baby (e.g., horns or tail) well schedule the woman for her government-mandated exorcism there and then. I hope after reviewing Santorumcare, youll agree that its the best health-care plan out there for you and your family. But just in case youre not sold yet, maybe this will seal the deal: leeches are a hundred per cent covered. Vote for me, Rick ",2
1,"Think the U.S. stock market is in turmoil now? Here are five legendary financial crises that will put it in some perspective. 1. The Great Depression, 1929-1939 Via History.com On October 29, 1929, the U.S. stock market suffered a blow it would take a decade to overcome when stockbrokers started passing that black-and-white photo of the sad woman with her kids around the Wall Street trading floor, bringing everyone to tears. 2. Eisenhowers Bad Trade, 1958 Via History.com Nearing the end of his presidency, Dwight D. Eisenhower traded every train in America to Switzerland in exchange for a neon sign that said Wine Is My Christ, which he hung above his headboard in the Lincoln Bedroom. The blow that this complete lack of trains dealt to Americas transit infrastructure had massive economic ramifications that certain facets of the industrial sector are still recovering from today. 3. Doug Emmert Decides To Buy A Stock, 1971 When Doug Emmert of Oswego, IL decided to buy two shares of Macys stock on February 2, 1971, the previously balanced market was sent into a tailspin, plummeting the U.S. into a deep recession. 4. The Dot-Com Bubble Crash, 1999 The 90s were heady days for speculation about the future of online technology, but it all came crashing down in 1999, when Bill Gates announced once and for all that when a computer communicates with another computer, it does not make them friendsthey are simply exchanging information. 5. The $20 Bill Scare, 2002 In 2002, it was discovered that if you fold a $20 bill a certain way, you can make it look like the Twin Towers are burning in a similar fashion to the way they did on 9/11. Not knowing what they were in for, people kept trying it, and they would become so horrified that they would quickly tear up their money and throw it into the trash, resulting in a net loss of $1.2 billion.

1,"Today Speaker of the House John Boehner issued the following letter to the American people: Dear American People, Yesterday, your hardworking House Republicans tried, once again, and failed, once again, to repeal Obamacare. And I really thought we had a good chance this time. Thats because we were all united in our hatred for this infernal and takes-too-long-to-read law. Every last one of us cast his vote to strike it down, from crazy little Paul Ryan to that arrogant bastard Eric Cantor. And I wish you could have seen the faces of those freshman Republicans as they voted to repeal Obamacareso innocent, so full of hope and wonder. As I told them yesterday, Youll never forget your first time. Its important for you to know that even as scandals swirl about the cesspool known as the White House, some folks in Washington are still working hard for the American people. It was a gruelling week for me, what with popping up in front of the TV cameras every five minutes saying, Whos going to jail?, plus trying to rid our land of Obamacare. But I dont want your thanks. Save that for the dedicated House Republicans who have now voted thirty-seven times to repeal. You cant put a price tag on that kind of performance. Well, actually, you can: its cost the taxpayers over fifty million dollars. And worth every million, damn it. One last thing. I know some of you are probably thinking that after suffering this latest defeat, we House Republicans are just going to take our bat and ball and go home. Well, theres an old saying where I come from: the thirty-eighth times the charm. Courage, John Boehner ",2
1,"Well, heres even more proof that self-starting young people are just amazing. When East Springfield High School lost funding for its ROTC program, dozens of young cadets were left without an extracurricular outlet. Thats when these resilient students stepped up big time and created their own on-campus paramilitary organization! They were told that they could no longer use the schools field for drilling. They were told the program was done for good. But these awesome and resourceful teens didnt listen. They pooled their money together to replace their ROTCs firearms arsenal. And it didnt stop there. Pretty soon, theyd renewed their efforts to acquire a fleet of ATVs, several months of survival rounds, and a bulk crate of live ammunition, and even designed an eye-catching new red armband that all the members are now sporting. Wow. Hows that for grit? These kids refused to let their ROTC program die. They made a plan, they acted on it, and now they effectively control a large part of the woods surrounding their small town and no longer attend classes! Nobodys really sure what theyre up to all hours of the day and night, but they sure look sharp marching up and down the towns main thoroughfare! If only every high school student could show half this groups drive and determination. And to think that this incredible paramilitary organization started from just a few budget cuts! These kids are awesome, and though it remains to be seen exactly what they want, it looks like we can expect big things from this group of armed young men and women. ",2
1,"Arguing that its current system of laws is out of step with life in todays Florida, a growing chorus of lawmakers in the state are arguing for a measure that would eliminate laws altogether. Florida is rife with laws that say Do this, dont do that, said Gov. Rick Scott, a supporter of the measure. Speaking as a Floridian, I have found it exhausting pretending to obey them. There is broad support in the state for abolishing laws, according to a poll commissioned by the political action committee Citizens For a Lawless Florida. According to that poll, a majority of Floridians favor ridding the state of laws, while a sizable number did not know that the state had any. Weve been trying to remove laws piecemeal for the past few decades, but this measure seems like the most efficient way to take care of the whole problem, Gov. Scott said. For those who fear that eradicating Floridas laws would wreak havoc on life in the state, Gov. Scott offered this reassurance: Honestly, I dont think youll notice a difference. ",2
1,"Responding to reports that President Obama is considering signing as many as nineteen executive orders on gun control, Republicans in Congress unleashed a blistering attack on him today, accusing Mr. Obama of cynically and systematically using his position as President to lead the country. Spearheading the offensive was Rep. Steve Stockman (R-Texas), who charged the President with the wanton exploitation of powers that are legally granted to him under the U.S. Constitution. Calling him the Law Professor-in-Chief, Rep. Stockman accused Mr. Obama of manipulating a little-known section of the Constitution, Article II, which outlines the power of the President. President Obama looks down the list of all of the powers that are legally his and hes like a kid in a candy store, Rep. Stockman said. Its nauseating. The Texas congressman said that if Mr. Obama persists in executing the office of the Presidency as defined by the Constitution, he could face impeachment and/or deportation. Noting that the President has not yet signed the executive orders on gun control, Rep. Stockman said that he hoped his stern words would serve as a wake-up call to Mr. Obama: Mr. President, theres still time for you to get in line. But if you continue to fulfill the duties of President of the United States that are expressly permitted in the Constitution, you are playing with fire. ",2

1,"Citing the scandals embroiling Wisconsin Governor Scott Walker and New Jersey Governor Chris Christie, the Republican Governors Association today ordered its members to discontinue the use of e-mail, effective immediately. According to a memo sent to all Republican governors, Any plots, schemes, conspiracies, or violations of campaign-finance laws should be conducted using pay phones or easily disposable cell phones such as the ones used on The Wire. The governors were instructed to read the memo once and then either burn or eat it. Asked to comment on the new policy, Governor Walkers office responded, The recipients e-mail address was not found in the recipients e-mail system. Please check the e-mail address and try resending this message. ",2
1,"Congressional Republicans on Friday expressed outrage at the new leadership style that President Obama has demonstrated in the aftermath of the midterm elections, and demanded a return of the passive and unassertive Obama to which we have grown accustomed. In a joint statement, House Speaker John Boehner and his counterpart in the Senate, Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, accused Obama of engaging in a flagrant display of leadership that we find deeply offensive. For the past six years, we have enjoyed a President who has been conciliatory and acquiescent to the point of emasculation, Boehner said. We want that President back. McConnell threatened that if Obama does not return to his weak and ineffectual ways at once, he will face the prospect of being a two-term President. At the White House, the President did not respond to the Republicans remarks, telling reporters that he planned to work through the weekend raising the minimum wage, granting amnesty to immigrants, and legalizing marijuana.

1," A conservative school board in Arvada, Colorado, that earlier purged its history curriculum of materials it deemed unpatriotic has voted to ban students from its schools for espousing similarly objectionable views. At the end of the day, it would be the height of hypocrisy to ban unpatriotic books from our schools but allow unpatriotic students to attend them, Harland Dorrinson, a spokesman for the school board, said. This was a very easy call for us. By transforming its schools into student-free zones, he explained, Arvada expects to realize significant cost savings, mainly through the elimination of teachers. Dorrinson said that he was cautiously optimistic that the boards latest action would serve as a model for other school districts across the country. There isnt a school in America whose problems couldnt be solved by removing its students, he said. ",4
1,"In what may be the most serious allegation ever made against the former Secretary of State, Fox News Channel reported today that Hillary Clinton was involved in the conspiracy to murder President Abraham Lincoln. The latest charge against Mrs. Clinton was reported by Fox host Sean Hannity, who said that the evidence of her role in the Lincoln assassination came mainly in the form of e-mails. According to Mr. Hannity, If its true that Hillary Clinton killed Lincoln, this could have a major impact on her chances in 2016. The accusation against Mrs. Clinton drew a strong response from Sen. Lindsey Graham (R.S. Carolina): Theres been a concerted effort by Hillary Clinton to cover up her role in President Lincolns murder. She has said nothing about it. This is bigger than Watergate, the Cuban missile crisis, and the Second World War put together. Responding to the allegation, Mrs. Clinton issued a terse statement indicating that she could not have participated in Lincolns assassination because she was born in 1947. Thats what she wants us to believe, Sen. Graham said. ",2
1,"Potential Republican Presidential candidate Sen. Rand Paul (R-Kentucky) said today that he believes he has a secret weapon that will derail Hillary Clintons 2016 White House bid: A little-known affair between her husband and a White House intern, Monica Lewinsky. Appearing on the Fox News Channel, Paul told the host Sean Hannity, Sean, when the American people find out about this scandal, they are going to be shocked, truly shocked. It didnt get a lot of coverage at the time. Asked by Hannity how the scandal could have remained under wraps for so long, Paul replied, Youll have to ask Bill and Hillary that. Lets just say theyve pulled a lot of strings to keep this story out of the mainstream media. Unfortunately for them, Sean, I have the details on this juicy scandal and Im prepared to share them with the American people, he said. I think its going to be a game-changer. While he believes that the shocking revelations about President Clintons Oval Office dalliances will be enough to destroy Hillarys 2016 ambitions, Paul confirmed that he has other arrows in his quiver. It turns out that Hillary was involved in a business deal called Whitewater, he said. When the American people find out about this, its going to blow their minds. ",2
1,"Weve seen a lot of clueless companies misuse Twitter, but its going to be hard to top the blunder Ace Hardware just made. Yesterday, @AceHardware sent out numerous tweets proving that the company has no idea what hammers are. This would be pretty embarrassing for any organization, but for a hardware store, its even worse. Read the tweets for yourself and youll see how big a mistake it was: Youd hope it wouldve stopped there, but the company kept going. Its hard not to cringe as you watch Ace put its foot in its mouth over and over again. After thousands of people flooded Aces Twitter feed and other social media channels with responses that the item was a hammer, the company was quick to delete its tweets. But by that point, the damage was already done. This morning, the organization seems to be in crisis mode, and has already issued an apology: Yikes. This debacle proves that social media is a double-edged sword. If used correctly, Twitter can build your brand, but just one carelessly worded tweet about hammers can leave you with a whole lot of egg on your face. ",2
1," President Obamas call during his State of the Union address to stop more tragedies from visiting innocent Americans received a frosty response from the pro-tragedy wing in Congress last night. After Mr. Obama made his controversial stopping-tragedies remark, prominent pro-tragedy members of Congress looked on in stony silence, refusing to applaud. I thought it was offensive and inappropriate, said Sen. David Vitter (R-Louisiana). If the President wants coperation from Congress, he should refrain from his divisive and inflammatory anti-tragedy rhetoric. The pro-tragedy lobby is among the most powerful in Washington, spending millions annually to defeat politicians who oppose tragedies. Another congressman with a strong pro-tragedy voting record, Rep. Joe Wilson (R-South Carolina), also blasted the Presidents remark, accusing Mr. Obama of conducting a war on tragedy. If the President really thinks he is going to prevent more tragedies, he should be prepared for a fight, Rep. Wilson said. The American peoples right to tragedies is protected by the United States Constitution. ",2
1,"If youre keeping score at home about whether or not a War on Christmas is going on in this country, it looks like you can add another tally to the Yes side: Historically black churches in the South keep getting burned down. Yep, this ones pretty much an open-and-shut case. Sure, its easy to write off the War on Christmas as hyperbolic, but from Briar Creek Road Baptist Church in North Carolina to Gods Power Church of Christ in Georgia, 2015 has seen multiple fires intentionally set to predominately black churches. Its pretty difficult to say that there isnt something going on when stuff like this keeps happening. Just look at the facts: Cashiers now say Happy Holidays instead of Merry Christmas. Nativity scenes are being removed from city halls. Churches where members of the African-American community go to celebrate their faith are getting deliberately burned down. And of course, who can forget the recent Starbucks red cup fiasco? This isnt the first time these types of churches have been burned down, either. With a little digging, youll discover that its clear that they have been targeted and purposely set ablaze for decades, going back well before the 1960s! The phrase War on Christmas is a fairly recent addition to our lexicon, but when you look at the long history of terror that has been waged against black churches, it definitely seems like a war has been going on for much longereven before people started saying Winter Break. Whatever that is. Oh, and just last month, the FBI arrested two men who were planning to bomb a primarily black church. Of course, we understand that not everyone celebrates Christmas, but isnt this going just a little too far? With the holiday season coming up, youll hear a lot of people dismiss the War on Christmas as a right-wing talking point. But the next time you hear someone say Happy Holidays or read about a predominantly black church burning down, maybe youll think twice. ",2
1," As the mystery surrounding the absence of dictator Kim Jong-un deepens, the North Korean government on Wednesday issued an official statement reassuring its citizens that it had a deep bench of brutal madmen. While it offered no comment about the status of Kim, the statement from the Korean Central News Agency (KCNA) emphasized that making North Korea an authoritarian horror-drome is not the achievement of one man; it has been and will always be a team effort. There are at least twelve highly unbalanced people at the upper echelon of this government who, at a moments notice, can imprison an ex-lover, execute a relative, or threaten to incinerate the United States in a sea of fire, the statement read. No other government has a roster that strong. As North Koreans, youve come to expect a level of mercurial brutality unrivalled by any other country on the planet, the statement continued. As your leaders, we promise that will never change. In a further effort to reassure the North Korean people, the statement concluded with a declaration of war against Mars. ",4
1,"Yesterday was an emotional day in China, as the Peoples Liberation Army held a national military funeral for movie star Sean Penn. It was a time for solemn mourning and reflection, and Chinese people all across the country took the day off work to attend the many elaborate ceremonies and pay their final respects to the Hollywood legend. Somber military processionals were held throughout all major Chinese cities featuring hundreds of thousands of Chinese soldiers marching in lockstep. According to reports, Chinese citizens across the country lined the streets and threw flowers at the feet of the marching soldiers, with many weeping or clutching framed photographs of Sean Penn to their chests. Since the Chinese military was not able to recover Penns body, a life-size mannequin was produced and placed inside an ornate ivory casket. Chinese president Xi Jinping himself then stepped forward, visibly sobbing, and placed a Chinese flag over Sean Penns coffin. From Carlitos Way to Milk, Sean Penns art and work have touched our souls and enriched our lives, President Xi said in a statement that was broadcast nationally on every major Chinese news station. We shall never forget Sean Penn, and his legacy will live on forever in the hearts and minds of the Peoples Republic of China. The military band then played the Chinese national anthem as a small group of soldiers gently placed the casket into a five-story mausoleum within the Sean Penn shrine. Today, the Chinese people have returned to work, but a rotating battalion of armed guards will stand 24-hour watch over Sean Penns mausoleum forever. Its a poignant way to honor an artist who produced such powerful work. ",4
1,"Millions of Tea Party loyalists fled the United States in the early morning hours today, seeking what one of them called the American dream of liberty from health care. Harland Dorrinson, 47, a tire salesman from Lexington, Kentucky, packed up his family and whatever belongings he could fit into his Chevy Suburban just hours before the health-insurance exchanges opened, joining the Tea Partys Freedom Caravan with one goal in mind: escape from Obamacare. My father didnt have health care and neither did my fathers father before him, he said. Ill be damned if Im going to let my children have it. But after driving over ten hours to the Canadian border, Mr. Dorrinson was dismayed to learn that Americas northern neighbor had been in the iron grip of health care for decades. The border guard was so calm when he told me, as if it was the most normal thing in the world, he said. Its like he was brainwashed by health care. Turning away from Canada, Mr. Dorrinson joined a procession of Tea Party cars heading south to Mexico, noting, They may have drug cartels and narcoterrorism down there, but at least theyve kept health care out. Mr. Dorrinson was halfway to the southern border before he heard through the Tea Party grapevine that Mexico, too, has public health care, as do Great Britain, Japan, Turkey, Spain, Belgium, New Zealand, Slovenia, and dozens of other countries to which he had considered fleeing. Undaunted, Mr. Dorrinson said he had begun looking into additional countries, like Chad and North Korea, but he expressed astonishment at a world seemingly overrun by health care. It turns out that the United States is one of the last countries on earth to get it, he said. It makes me proud to be an American. ",4
1,"Becoming a star in the world of hip-hop is all about earning respect, and part of earning respect is going head-to-head with those who disrespect you. Here are a few of the most epic hip-hop feuds of all time. 1. 50 Cent and Ja Rule The feud between these two hip-hop moguls originated in the early 2000s, when Ja Rule borrowed 50 Cents DVD of The Shawshank Redemption and never gave it back. Ja Rule claims that he doesnt remember borrowing the DVD, but 50 Cent is adamant that he lent it to him, going so far as to implore Ja Rule to at least look around for it on his 2002 single Wanksta. 2. Diddy and Suge Knight The East Coast vs. West Coast beef goes way back with these two. Born on the same day on opposite sides of the country, the infants Diddy and Suge Knight came into the world and immediately sprinted out of the hospital, charging across multiple states until finally meeting up in a field in Nebraska, where they began strangling each other. Decades later, they still havent stopped. 3. Nicki Minaj and Lil Kim In an attempt to prove herself as an up-and-coming artist, Nicki Minaj rapped on her debut album about Lil Kim being swallowed by a pelican. The diss so enraged Lil Kim that she fired back with a brutal track about Nicki Minaj being swallowed by a pelican as well. Never one to back down, Minaj immediately released an entire album in which Lil Kim is swallowed by a pelican once in every song. Many have speculated about how Kim will respond to this latest transgression, but chances are shes not going to turn the other cheek. 4. T.I. and Ludacris These two ATL rappers have been fiercely competitive with each other for most of their respective careers, but luckily, this hip-hop beef has a happy ending. The two buried the hatchet in 2007, collaborating on a track in which T.I. rhymed Ludacris with phenomenal kiss and Ludacris rhymed T.I. with great guy, a symbol of their newfound respect for one another. 5. Eminem and Several Unruly Swans Nobody knows what a few unruly swans did in 1999 to incur the wrath of Eminem, but the Detroit rapper has railed against them for more than a decade in both his music and his personal life. Its not all swans I have a problem with, just several of them that I happen to know are very unruly, said Eminem on the red carpet at the 2003 Grammys. Those unruly ones are always causing problems and are, on the whole, way too rowdy. I refuse to even be in the same room as them. 6. 2Pac and Biggie After being friends for years, 2Pac and Biggie had a falling out over differing opinions about the 1992 general election in the United Kingdom. 2Pac was a Labour supporter, while Biggie championed John Major and the Conservatives.

1," In a deepening humanitarian crisis, residents of the city of Austin report that they are completely surrounded by Texas, a situation that locals are calling dire. Austin has traditionally enjoyed freedoms as a semi-autonomous region, hosting film festivals and literary events without the interference of its hostile neighbors, but there are growing fears that those days may be coming to an end. Alarmingly, citizens of Austin report, extremists within the city limits have taken over the Capitol Building and installed a militant government with dominion over its residents. In recent days, Austin has made desperate requests for assistance to the U.S. military, which will be conducting exercises in Texas in July. The city is hoping that the United States will use its military might to liberate the isolated municipality and transform it into an independent state along the lines of Kurdistan.

Some have questioned the appropriateness of the President speaking to such an extremist group, especially because in the past it has issued threats against the United States government. As recently as 2013, for example, the extremists threatened to shut down the entire federal government if their demands were not met. On Tuesday afternoon, the White House defended the Presidents decision to speak to the extremists, pointing out that the Administration had also initiated dialogues with Iran and North Korea. ",2
1,"Speaker of the House John Boehner (R-Ohio) said today that he plans to sue President Obama for violating the United States Constitution with what Boehner called his outrageous practice of accomplishing things. The United States Constitution guarantees the American people that its government will be free from activity, Boehner told reporters. Again and again, President Obama has broken that sacred trust. Ripping the President for his willful insistence on doing things, Speaker Boehner said that his lawsuit was intended to restore the inaction and inertia that have been the hallmarks of our democracy. The Speaker acknowledged that suing the President was an extreme measure, but added, I take this step only after exhausting every other method to prevent him from getting anything done. Concluding his remarks, Boehner said that he hoped his lawsuit would send a powerful message to President Obama: If you stubbornly continue to take actions that result in tangible outcomes, you will be very, very sorry.

1," A rising chorus of congressional Republicans are calling on President Obama to acknowledge that the pop singer Beyonc lip-synched during his inaugural festivities on Monday and resign from office, effective immediately. By lip-synching the national anthem, Beyonc has cast a dark cloud over the Presidents second term, said Sen. Rand Paul (R-Kentucky). The only way President Obama can remove that cloud is by resigning from office at once. While many in the media have blamed Beyonc for the lip-synching controversy, Mr. Paul said, We must remember that this happened on President Obamas watch. Mr. Paul said that the White Houses refusal to comment on the Beyonc crisis only serves the argument that this President has something to hide. If Beyonc lip-synched the national anthem, how do we know President Obama didnt lip-sync his oath of office? he said. If thats the case, hes not legally President. But just to be on the safe side, he should resign anyway. Mr. Paul also blasted Secretary of State Hillary Clinton for her testimony on Benghazi before the Senate today: Her tactic of answering each and every question we asked her didnt fool anyone. ",2
1,"Credit Photograph by Aude Guerrucci/picture-alliance/dpa/AP WASHINGTON (Satire from The selfnews)Adding a new wrinkle in an already unpredictable election year, Donald Trump saw his poll numbers plummet on Monday after receiving a surprise endorsement from President Barack Obama. The long-awaited downfall of the abrasive billionaire came in startling fashion, as few had expected the President to offer a full-throated endorsement of Trump, especially on the eve of the all-important Super Tuesday primaries. Praising the Republican front-runner during a nationally televised address, the President said that, despite media reports to the contrary, Trump shared his views on such important issues as immigration and religious tolerance. In every way that matters, Donald and I are on exactly the same page, Obama said, pointing to a framed picture of the billionaire on his Oval Office desk. Concluding his endorsement with an emphatic closing argument, Obama said, If you love me, vote for Trump. In several G.O.P. polls taken after the Presidents stunning endorsement, Trump sank from first to fifth place, trailing the retired neurosurgeon Ben Carson by several points. As news of the Presidents endorsement spread, former Trump supporters across the nation gathered to vent their anger, with some burning signs, trucker hats, and other campaign paraphernalia at impromptu bonfires. Harland Dorrinson, who had attended a massive Trump rally in Alabama just a day earlier, said that he now felt totally betrayed by the billionaire. I guess when all is said and done, Donald Trump was just too good to be true, he said. News satire from The selfnews.

1,"Supreme Court Justice Antonin Scalia lashed out at the cable network A&E today, calling its decision to suspend Phil Robertson, the star of the TV series Duck Dynasty, unconstitutional, and demanding that it be overturned at once. Speaking at a press conference with fellow Justice Clarence Thomas, a visibly angry Scalia told reporters that Robertson was exercising his First Amendment right to express an opinionan opinion, I might add, that many other great Americans agree with. He warned that the suspension of the Duck star would have a chilling effect on freedom of speech in America: If Phil Robertson can be muzzled for expressing this perfectly legitimate view, whats to prevent the same thing from happening to, say, a Justice of the Supreme Court? He added that, while he was a huge Duck Dynasty fan who never misses an episode, his objection to Mr. Robertsons suspension was purely on Constitutional grounds. Declaring that A&Es decision will not stand, Justice Scalia said he would ask the Supreme Court to meet in an emergency session to overturn it: This offensive decision by A&E is a clear violation of the Constitution, and Im not the only one on the Court who feels that way. Right, Clarence? Justice Thomas had no comment. ",2
1,"In a stunning decision on the future of health care in America, the Supreme Court decided today that annual physicals were unconstitutional and should be replaced by random strip searches conducted by the nations police. The decision, which appeared to expand the role of the police to include such duties as performing breast and prostate exams, took many in both the health-care and law-enforcement communities by surprise. Writing for the majority, Justice Antonin Scalia wrote, While the Constitution makes no provisions for health care, it explicitly defends the peoples right to form militias; clearly, the Founders believed that if anyone should be looking up our asses it shouldnt be a doctor, but someone with a gun. By replacing annual checkups with random strip searches, the Court raised worries in the health-care community that patients would not get the care they need, but those concerns were brushed aside by Justice Samuel Alito. Ultimately, the responsibility to secure adequate medical attention falls to the citizen, he said. When a policeman is searching his body cavities, for example, its up to the citizen to say, Theres a mole Id like you to look at. Justice Clarence Thomas wrote that he was personally ready for a random strip search/exam at any moment, adding, Ive got nothing on under this robe. ",3

In proposing an addition to the uterus, a major female reproductive sex organ, Trump sought to draw a distinction between such a wall and the wall that the uterus already has, commonly referred to as the uterine wall. No, no, no, this would be a much better wall than that wall, Trump said. People are going to love this wall.

1,"Across the United States on Wednesday, a heated national debate began on the extremely complex issue of children firing military weapons. Every now and then, the nation debates an issue that is so complicated and tricky it defies easy answers, says pollster Davis Logsdon. Letting small children fire automatic weapons is such an issue. Logsdon says that the thorny controversy is reminiscent of another ongoing national debate, about whether it is a good idea to load a car with dynamite and drive it into a tree. Many Americans think its a terrible idea, but others believe that with the correct supervision, its perfectly fine, he says. Whos to say whos right? Similar, he says, is the national debate about using a flamethrower indoors. There has been a long and contentious national conversation about this, he says. Its another tough one. Much like the long-running national debates about jumping off a roof, licking electrical sockets, and gargling with thumbtacks, the vexing question of whether children should fire military weapons does not appear headed for a swift resolution. Like the issue of whether you should sneak up behind a bear and jab it with a hot poker, this wont be settled any time soon, he says. ",2

In an unusually forthcoming interview with the Korean Central News Agency (K.C.N.A.), Kim said it was hurtful that the Republicans would send a letter to one of the United States most longstanding enemies while totally snubbing another. Lets just call it what it is: theyre playing favorites with enemies, Kim said. I try not to take things personally, but its hard to see them sending letters to Iran without feeling a little bit hurt. Kim said that over the past two days he had his aides checking his mailbox on an hourly basis in hopes of finding a letter from the Republicans, but now he has pretty much given up hope. Honestly, I thought Id at least rate a text or something, but , he said, his voice trailing off. I dont like to beat myself up, but part of me is like, What does Iran have that I dont have? he said.

1,"In a rare announcement from a notoriously publicity-shy group, Chinese hackers revealed today that they were dropping the United States government from their official list of high-value targets. We have to allocate our time and energy to hacking powerful organizations, a spokesman for the hackers said. Right now, calling the United States government an organization would be a reach. He added that the hackers ultimate goal had been to hurl the U.S. government into a state of abject paralysis, and they seem to have already taken care of that on their own. The spokesman acknowledged that despite years of compromising U.S. government computers, the hackers had obtained little of value, especially on the hard drives of congressional offices. Those computers did not appear to be used for anything work-related, the spokesman said. Basically all we found were restaurant reservations and porn. U.S. stock markets plummeted on the news of the hackers downgrade, which was widely denounced by American politicians as a hostile act designed to cripple the economy. This is an insult to the American people, said House Majority Leader Eric Cantor (R-Virginia). We demand that the Chinese resume hacking us at once. But according to the hackers spokesman, any chance that they might put the U.S. government back on their list of targets was remote at best. We need to focus on higher-functioning governments, he said. Were taking a close look at Venezuela. ",4
1,"In what historians are calling an unprecedented development in American politics, both major parties decided today to cancel the 2012 election. The decision to scrap the 2012 contest came on the heels of a new poll showing President Barack Obama with an approval rating of a hundred per cent, believed to be a record high for an American President. Mr. Obama even polled well among Republicans, with a majority of G.O.P. voters agreeing with the statement, I no longer care that he wasnt born here. The new bipartisan spirit sweeping the nation was captured well by House Speaker John Boehner (R., Ohio), who tearfully told reporters, This is a great day for America oh, leave me alone, goddamn it. Republican Presidential hopeful Donald Trump made no official announcement, but sources said he was considering running for Prime Minister of Canada. The cancellation of the election comes in the aftermath of the death of Osama bin Laden, whose last words reportedly were, I knew I shouldnt have signed up for Foursquare. Of all the major news networks, Fox News did not report news of bin Ladens death, saying that it would air cartoons until further notice. In Libya, Colonel Muammar Qaddafi issued the following official statement: Uh-oh. In North Korea, President Kim Jong-il said this: I have lost my last friend on Facebook.

According to most projections, Facebooks I.P.O. should net Mr. Zuckerberg a personal fortune of twenty-eight billion dollars. I couldnt make a pile of dough-re-mi like that even if I fired people twenty-four hours a day. Now, lets take a look at Mitt Romneys net worth: a measly two hundred million dollars. Now do you see why I consider myself poor? Compared to Mark Zuckerberg, Mitt Romney is practically a crack whore. Now, Im not going to sit here and envy a rich person like Mark Zuckerberg. Thats exactly what President Obama wants poor people like me to do. Mark Zuckerberg made his money fair and square, by creating useful products like imaginary sheep and angry birds. Say what you will about Facebook, it has totally revolutionized the way we waste our lives. The fact is, if youre poor in America, you should do what Mark Zuckerberg did: create a social network.

1,"In what critics are calling a desperate attempt to draw the medias attention away from Donald Trump, the other fifteen candidates for the Republican nomination have released a joint sex tape. The tape, including such luminaries as former Arkansas governor Mike Huckabee, Texas senator Ted Cruz, former Florida governor Jeb Bush, and New Jersey governor Chris Christie, appeared briefly on major news Web sites before an avalanche of viewer revulsion demanded it be taken down. According to Carol Foyler, a viewer who happened to catch the tape during its brief appearance on the CNN Web site, the video contained images I may never be able to get out of my mind. I couldnt believe that these people would participate in such a thing, she said. Except maybe Santorum. A spokesman for Rick Perry defended the former Texas governors appearance on the tape.

When asked point-blank whether he considered women humans, the billionaire responded, It should be a case-by-case thing. Trump also blasted the media for applying what he called a double standard to his remarks about women. I can call a woman a pig and its totally taken out of context, he said. Trumps latest comments drew a strong rebuke from his chief rival, Senator Ted Cruz, on the campaign trail in Wisconsin.

We were all like, Harland, every time you talk about this, people start to lose consciousness, says Carol Foyler, a former friend who has cut ties with Mr. Dorrinson over his fiscal-cliff obsession. I dont know what effect the fiscal cliff will have in January, but if youre stuck in a conversation with Harland the effect is you want to drown yourself. For his part, Mr. Dorrinson says that his ex-friends who have shown no interest in the fiscal cliff are a bunch of losers who dont know what theyre missing. I guess there are people out there who arent interested in whether capital-gains taxes and marginal rates will rise, or which Republicans have backed away from Grover Norquists anti-tax pledge, he says. But seriously, would you want to be friends with someone like that? Or, for that matter, married to one? If Mr. Dorrinson has a regret, it is that the fiscal-cliff issue will be resolved one way or the other by the end of the year: I know Im going to experience a profound feeling of loss when its gone.

1,"Few schools had it harder than Coleridge Elementary in Detroit. For years, dwindling budgets made it impossible for the school to buy supplies like new textbooks or computers, and faculty cutbacks resulted in class sizes of more than 30 students per teacher. But theres finally some good news for this struggling school: A wealthy timpani player donated $60 million to help them build a world-class timpani program. What an incredible gesture! The philanthropist is Eric Gustav, a timpani enthusiast and heir to an immense fortune who saw a problem he knew he could fix. Before his amazing gift, Coleridge Elementarys timpani program consisted of one decimated timpani with only a single mallet that all 900 students had to share, far below the national average. But now, the school ranks first in timpani education, and its all thanks to one man. Growing up, I never needed to worry about whether I would have access to a timpani or not, explained Eric during a public ceremony at the school. Every child should have the blessing of timpanis in their lives, no matter how much money they have. So generous! The grant has already had a transformative effect on the schools timpani classes. Every single student will have access to a timpani of the highest quality that was manufactured in a 100-year-old Italian drum factory. Previously, the school employed a single music teacher, but now its been able to hire 25 full-time timpani tutors, as well as invite timpani guest speakers from leading philharmonics around the world. Best of all, the school was able to purchase an adjacent lot to build an 800-seat concert hall just for timpani practice and timpani recitals. Last week, things seemed hopeless for the students of Coleridge Elementary. But today, thanks to one mans magnanimous gift, things are finally looking up for these kids when it comes to playing the timpani. If you needed proof that good still exists in the world, here it is. Bravo! ",2

The poll, which was conducted by the University of Minnesotas Opinion Research Institute, shows Muslim Question Guy leading the G.O.P. field with thirty-four per cent as opposed to nineteen per cent for Trump. In interviews with poll respondents, Republicans gave Muslim Question Guy high marks for stating that President Obama was neither Christian nor American and criticized Trump for not being more vocal in his agreement on those points. Minutes after the poll was released, however, Trump was on the offensive, attacking Muslim Question Guy during an appearance on CNN. People who are supporting this guy havent done their homework, the businessman said. If you look back over the past seven years, no one has called Obama a foreign-born Muslim more often than I have.

Its good for me to keep up on whats going on around here. Its not good when I turn on the news and theyre talking about something at the White House and Im like, whoa, when did that happen?

Elaborating on his strategy, Sen. Cruz added, By defunding Obamacare, we would basically be saying to Assad, This is how we attack our own President, so just imagine what well do to you. That would make him think twice before he pulls another one of his stunts. You can fire off as many Tomahawk missiles as you want, said Sen. Cruz. But they wont have the same impact on Syria as defunding Obamacare. Shortly after his appearance, Sen.

1,"Its that time of year. Just when you think bitterness, brutality, and violence have won the day, Christmas is here to remind you that theres still a whole lot of good in the world. Last night, in the disputed Syrian city of Raqqa, the American troops and ISIS put aside their differences and came together to celebrate Christmas. According to reports, the inspiring festivities began shortly after sunset on Christmas Eve, when members of the American-led coalition against the Islamic State stationed on the streets suddenly heard something that astonished them: the resonant voices of ISIS fighters as they walked toward them, their arms interlocked, their weapons nowhere to be found, singing Silent Night. The insurgents outpouring of Christmas joy was so stirring that, ignoring orders from the Pentagon and their commanding officers, American troops soon added their voices to the swelling chorus, abandoning their posts and mingling with their sometime enemies around a pine tree that one jihadist had cut down and adorned with makeshift Christmas decorations! It was the same scene all across ISIS-held territory in Syria and Iraq: Deep into the night and then into the morning, eyes shone with joyful tears as the fighters sang, fraternized, and even started games of pickup soccer with the very same young men and women who only hours before they would have publicly beheaded, hurled from a seven-story building, or shot with a sniper rifle from hundreds of yards away. If only for one day, the two sides were able to embrace, exchange modest gifts of food and cigarettes, and pray together in a solemn commemoration of the birth of Jesus Christ. Wow.

There are two important jobs for every spy agency: spying on people and avoiding detection, said the N.S.A. chief General Keith Alexander. Unfortunately, at the N.S.A. we have only done the first job well. We have abused the trust of some of our closest allies, he said. And none of this would have happened if they hadnt found out. General Alexander said that the agency was instituting strict new practices that amounted to a zero-tolerance policy on getting caught. I had a meeting with my top people today and said, I want you to put the same energy you put into spying on Germany, France, and Spain into keeping them from figuring out what were up to, he said. Anything less than that will be unacceptable. General Alexander also offered a heartfelt apology to German Chancellor Angela Merkel, a prime target of the agencys eavesdropping. I know how upsetting it must be for you to know that your closest ally has been listening in on your phone conversations for the past eleven years, he said. I give you my solemn promise that in the future you wont know. ",4
1,"The following message was released today by the National Alliance of Funeral Directors: This week, several Republican Supreme Court Justices have argued that the Affordable Care Act supported by the Obama Administration is unconstitutional. At the National Alliance of Funeral Directors, we couldnt agree more. It was Revolutionary War hero Patrick Henry who said, in 1775, Give me liberty or give me death. From that moment on, legal scholars have agreed that the Constitution guarantees every American the liberty to be dead. Here at the Alliance, we will fight for your right to be dead to the death. Lets take a look, if you will, at the Second Amendment of the Constitution, which protects every Americans right to shoot another American. It says nothing about giving the person who is shot health insurance to prevent him from dying. This cherished constitutional right to shoot people and make them dead is currently recognized in all fifty states, most recently Florida. In commenting on the Affordable Care Act this week, Justice Samuel Alito compared the Obama health-care plan to burial insurance. Coincidentally, burial insurance is the Republican health-care plan, and one that we enthusiastically support. Under this plan, every American would be mandated to buy a coffin from one of our member-owned and -operated funeral homes. May we recommend the Peaceful Valley Royale, a luxury mahogany casket with sienna satin interior and the finest imitation antique nickel handles ($2,899). As the organization representing Americas funeral directors, gravediggers, embalmers and cremators, we are confident that the Supreme Court will ultimately do the right thing and decide that health care flies in the face of every Americans constitutional right to the pursuit of deadness. And when they do, well be waiting for you. Sincerely, The National Alliance of Funeral Directors ",2
1,"A majority of Oregonians favor building a twenty-foot wall along the border of their state to prevent angry white men from getting in, a poll released on Monday shows. The survey indicates that Oregonians are fed up with irate male Caucasians pouring into their state and bringing with them guns, violence, and terrorism. This used to be such a nice state, said Oregon State Senator Carol Foyler, a pro-wall lawmaker. Since the angry white men came here, parts of it are unrecognizable. But even as support for the Oregon wall grows, critics of the proposal say that it does nothing to address the fact that there are already thousands of angry white men living in the state. Those critics favor forcibly removing the angry white men through mass deportations and resettling them elsewhere, possibly in Texas. While some argue that the deportation of angry white men would separate them from their families, others believe that their families would be O.K. with seeing them go.

1,"In its historic first democratic election, Egypt has followed the lead of the United States in electing a Muslim President, the Fox News Channel reported today. Sean Hannity, the Fox News host, noted that, in electing Mohamed Morsi of the Muslim Brotherhood, Egyptians were echoing the decision of American voters in 2008. The similarities between Obama and Morsi are striking, he said. Both come from radical political parties, and both have unfamiliar, foreign-sounding names. One key difference, of course, is that Morsi makes no secret of being a Muslim. Mr. Hannity predicted that the two Presidents could have a close working relationship going forward: Im sure President Obama has already called Morsi to congratulate him, one Muslim brother to another. Mr. Hannity said that the election of Mr. Morsi may be just the latest result in a trend that augurs well for Mr. Obamas own relection hopes: In recent months, Egypt elected a Muslim, France elected a Socialist, and Kenya elected a Kenyan.

1,"Is the purpose of prison to punish criminals, or to rehabilitate them into productive members of society? Sweden takes a more enlightened approach to incarceration. 1. In Sweden, inmates are given spacious homes in beautiful 18th-century apartment buildings, often with breathtaking vistas of the Baltic Sea. 2. Prisoners are able to go to class at the Royal Institute of Technology, a job-training program that teaches convicts how to find work after their release. Via kthphdchapter.com 3. Instead of building prisons with grim concrete walls and iron bars, Sweden uses soothing architectural designs to keep inmates calm and in good spirits. Via free-city-guides.com 4. Set aside your expectation of bland prison food. Swedish prisoners get to enjoy fika, a delicious snack consisting of coffee accompanied by pastries like a kanelbulle cinnamon roll. 5. There are plenty of recreational activities to prevent boredom and depression. You can often find inmates listening to music at the prisons ABBA museum. Via radiohamburg.de 6. State-of-the-art athletic facilities allow convicts to have fun while staying healthy. One of the most popular activities is to play ice hockey at the Ericsson Globe arena. Via esportstipster.net 7. Some might call all this treatment too lenient, but you cant argue with the results. Many prisoners are already working hard to repay their debt to society by giving Nobel Prizes to scientists. 8. The lesson Sweden teaches us is that showing prisoners compassion may actually be more effective than vengeance. Hopefully, other countries will follow their lead, and also give their inmates tours of the restored shipwreck Vasa. Its time to stop building dungeons and start helping prisoners turn their lives around. Via walktravel.net ",3
1,"In an unprecedented honor for the Rupert Murdoch-led network, the Fox News Channel today won the Pulitzer Prize for fiction. In its official statement, the prize committee praised Fox for exhibiting an imagination and inventiveness that rival the best of Charles Dickens and J. R. R. Tolkien. In hailing Fox, the committee singled out the networks fourteen-part story about President Obamas birth in a mud-hut in Kenya. For Mr. Murdoch, the stunning Pulitzer Prize win was a rare bright spot in what he acknowledged had been a difficult year. When I first heard about the Pulitzer committees decision, I didnt believe it, he said. I had to listen to their voice mails to hear it for myself. ",2
1,"Just minutes after the Supreme Court upheld President Obamas Affordable Care Act, Republican Presidential nominee Mitt Romney slammed the Court, calling the law the worst idea I ever had. I vow to repeal this law on my first day in office, he told a crowd at a campaign rally. Until then, I will work tirelessly to make people forget that I used to totally love it. At the White House, President Obama greeted the news of the Courts decision in muted fashion: I havent been this pumped since I smoked bin Laden. Dissenters in the 5-4 decision included Justice Antonin Scalia, who wrote, The only medical procedures the government should pay for are forced transvaginal ultrasounds and exorcisms. Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell also had harsh words for the health-care law, telling reporters, Under Obamacare, you will be forced to marry a gay doctor. But perhaps the most negative appraisal came from Speaker of the House John Boehner: This is a dark day for America. If we are forced to have health care, its only a matter of time before we have education. ",2
1,"A growing chorus of Republican lawmakers are demanding that President Obama take some action in Syria so that they can attack whatever action he took in Syria. Appearing on CBSs Face the Nation on Sunday, Sen. Lindsey Graham (R-South Carolina) laid out the situation in stark terms: The time for President Obama to do something in Syria that we can eviscerate him for is long overdue. Arguing that there are a variety of options available to Mr. Obama for dealing with Syria, Sen. Graham said, The President needs to choose one of those options so that we can immediately identify it as a catastrophic choice and demand that he be impeached. Sen. John McCain (R-Arizona) used an appearance on NBCs Meet the Press to express impatience with Mr. Obamas steadfast refusal to give us something new to rake him over the coals for. The American people have grown weary of my nonstop criticism of the Presidents handling of Libya, he said. They are ready to hear me incessantly berate him for his handling of a different country. At the end of his television appearance, Sen. McCain seemed to draw a line in the sand, making a direct challenge to Mr. Obama: Mr. President, we are sick and tired of attacking you for your inaction. The time has come for us to attack you for your action. ",2
1,"Congressional seats are on pace to fetch a whopping four billion dollars on Tuesday night, a record-smashing sales figure that has exceeded the expectations of even the most optimistic insiders. The seats, which include four hundred and thirty-five in the House of Representatives and thirty-six in the Senate, have attracted buyers from a broad spectrum of industries, including investment banking, energy, pharmaceutical, and gun. With all of the uncertainty in the world today, the United States Congress is considered a very safe place for the rich to invest their money, said Charles Michollot, of the auction house Sothebys. Congressional seats are like Manhattan real estatethey arent making any more of them. But Anton Pickardin, of the rival auction house Christies, sounds more skeptical. I hate to be a wet blanket, but these sales figures lack rhyme and reason, Pickardin said. When someone is willing to pay millions of dollars for a pre-owned Mitch McConnell, you know that people have lost their minds. But Sothebys Michollot remains confident that, even at these hefty prices, congressional seats are a wise investment. When these seats go up for sale again, in 2016, four billion dollars is going to look like a bargain, he said. ",4

1,"Millions of Americans are expressing their resentment and outrage at being put in the appalling position of siding with the Fox News anchor Megyn Kelly, a state of affairs that many are calling intolerable. Never in a million years did I envision a situation where I would be on the same side as Megyn Kelly, Tracy Klugian, of Butte, Montana, said. Now that I find myself in just such a situation, let me say this: its horrible. Truly horrible. Putting people through the ordeal of siding with Megyn Kelly could be the worst thing Donald Trump has done in this campaign, Jervis Kentwell, of Norwalk, Connecticut, said. I know he thinks hes invulnerable or whatever, but its hard to see him recovering from this. Harland Dorrinson, a psychologist from Akron, Ohio, has created an online community for people who are suffering from the emotional trauma of momentarily siding with Megyn Kelly. People who have despised Megyn Kelly for years are experiencing a sudden loss of identity and a feeling of emptiness, he said. Theyre complaining of persistent headaches and nausea. There is a lot of hurt out there. Carol Foyler, of Tacoma, Washington, worries about the long-term implications of being forced to side with Megyn Kelly. Is there some scenario where I might be forced to side with Bill OReilly, or Hannity? she asked. Its a goddam slippery slope. Watch: New dance-floor options for the least smooth among us. ",2
1,"Sixty-four unskilled workers will report to new jobs in Washington, D.C. on Tuesday as part of a federal jobs program that provides employment for people unable to find productive work elsewhere. The new hires, who have no talents or abilities that would make them employable in most workplaces, will be earning a first-year salary of $174,000. For that sum, the new employees will be expected to work a hundred and thirty-seven days a year, leaving them with two hundred and twenty-eight days of vacation. Some critics have blasted the federal jobs program as too expensive, noting that the workers were chosen last November in a bloated and wasteful selection process that cost the nation nearly four billion dollars. But Davis Logsdon, a University of Minnesota economics professor who specializes in labor issues, said that the program is necessary to provide work for people who honestly cannot find employment anywhere else. Expensive as this program is, it is much better to have these people in jobs than out on the street, he said. ",4
1,"By a 54 vote on Monday, the United States Supreme Court settled a dispute that Justice Samuel Alito said was at its core about the rights of women versus the rights of people. Writing for the majority, Justice Alito wrote, It is the duty of this Court, whenever it sees that the rights of people are being threatened, to do our best to safeguard those rights. In this case, it is clear that peoples rights were being threatened by women. Acknowledging that some women might argue that they, too, have some claim to being people, Justice Alito wrote, That is an interesting question for another day. While the Courts decision caused an uproar across the country, it received a big thumbs-up from one of the Justices who voted with the majority, Antonin Scalia. This has been a crappy year or so around here, what with all that gay-marriage stuff, but at least we finished strong, he said. ",4
1,"When it comes to true allies, its hard to find better friends to the LGBTQ community than Mitch and Lauren Hendrick. A lot of people say they support gay rights, but this couple went above and beyond by conceiving and raising a gay son. Thats right. Mitch and Laurens son, Daniel, is 16 years old and is sexually attracted to men. It would have been easy for the Hendricks to simply put a rainbow flag up in their window or change their Facebook profile pictures, but the couple instead took the time and effort to give birth to a son who is actually gay. Wow! Truly inspiring. Admittedly, the Hendricks still have a little ways to go before they become perfect allies. They have a straight daughter, and neither Mitch nor Lauren are themselves gay, but when you consider how much the average person actually does to help the LGBTQ movement, you have to admit that the Hendricks are really doing something remarkable. Of course, we cant expect everyone to go the same distance as the Hendricks have, but if the couple inspires even a few people to show their support for the gay community by having some gay children, our world will definitely be a better place. Looks like love wins again! ",2
1,"Republican Presidential candidates descended on Iowa over the weekend, giving Iowans a rare opportunity to evaluate all thirty thousand hopefuls in one place. The candidates were a big hit with their G.O.P. audience, who attempted to determine which of the thirty thousand would do the best job of eviscerating Obamacare and deporting college students. Attendees gave an especially warm welcome to the businessman Donald Trump, whose potential entry into the 2016 race would instantly raise the credibility of everyone else. In a speech laden with red meat for the Republican faithful, Trump explained how his experience of hosting a reality TV show would prove invaluable in defeating the Islamic State in Iraq and al-Sham (ISIS). But Iowans reserved their most enthusiastic response for Wisconsin Governor Scott Walker, who laid out an ambitious vision for depriving future generations of a living wage. Asked how he hopes history will remember him, Walker said, If I have my way, there will be no one teaching history. ",2
1," In what could be a prelude to a Presidential run in 2016, on Friday Joe Biden released to the public both e-mails that he has written while serving as Vice-President for the past six years. Biden took pride in announcing that he had sent both messages from his official government e-mail address, adding, I have nothing to hide. Minutes after the e-mails were released, the media pored over the treasure trove of materials, which offer a fascinating behind-the-scenes glimpse into Bidens tenure as Vice-President. The first e-mail, written to President Obama in December of 2009, asks about the time and place of the White House holiday party. The second and last e-mail, written in May of last year, asks the President, Is our Internet slow today? Im trying to watch something, followed by a frowny-face emoticon. According to Bidens records, the President did not respond to either e-mail. ",4
1,"Hoping to quell the controversy over e-mails missing from her private account, the former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton on Wednesday released twenty thousand spam e-mails she received from Old Navy. In an effort to be transparent, I have gone above and beyond what is required of me by law and released every last e-mail I received from this retailer, she told reporters. Now I think we can all consider this case closed. The e-mails reveal an extensive one-way correspondence between Clinton and Old Navy, as the retailer sometimes contacted her up to a dozen times in a single day to inform her of sales and other offers. This is one of the main reasons I set up a private e-mail account, she said. I did not want spam from Old Navy clogging up the State Department servers. But if the former Secretary of State thought that she could end the controversy swirling around her e-mail account by releasing the Old Navy spam, she may have miscalculated. Representative Trey Gowdy, the Republican chairman of the House Benghazi select committee, questioned why Clinton would let twenty thousand spam e-mails from Old Navy accumulate rather than simply unsubscribe. It doesnt pass the smell test, he said. Responding to that allegation, Clinton said, I want the American people to know that, on multiple occasions, I tried to unsubscribe from Old Navy, and my requests were ignored. The most frustrating part of this whole affair is that Ive never even bought anything from Old Navy. ",2

1,"In a break with tradition, Tea Party Republicans issued their official rebuttal to tonights State of the Union address a full twelve hours before President Obama was scheduled to deliver it. Sen. Rand Paul (R-Kentucky) appeared on Fox News Channel at 9 A.M. (E.T.) to read the rebuttal, which some historians called the most brutal response ever to a Presidential speech that had not yet been made. Calling Mr. Obamas speech full of the same empty promises and bald-faced lies weve come to expect, Sen. Paul added that tonight Barack Obama made his case: for his own impeachment. Laced with sarcasm and invective, Sen. Pauls rebuttal eviscerated Mr. Obamas not-yet-given speech, ending with a call for the President to be tried for treason and banished from the U.S. Roger Ailes, President of Fox News Channel, defended the decision to air a blistering attack on a speech that Mr. Obama was not scheduled to give for another twelve hours: Our viewers are very unlikely to sit through Barack Obamas State of the Union address. Airing the rebuttal beforehand gives them a sense of what they would have thought was reprehensible about it. For his part, Sen. Paul made no apologies for calling a speech he had never actually heard worthy of President Ahmadinejad. Look, if I had waited to listen to the speech, I bet I would have hated it even more. ",2

We caught up with him as he took a breather for the Fouth of July, at his home in East Hampton. First of alland I have to ask thisGod particle? Really? Who started that? I have gotten so much shit for that! (laughs) I dont know where that started. Probably TMZ or somewhere! Look, if people want to call me that because they like what I do well, Im humbled. Its cool to know that what you do makes people happy. I love my fans. But God particle? I dont think so! I cant even get my iPhone to sync. (laughs) Speaking of what you do what do you do, exactly? Probably what Im best known for, for better or worse, is making atomic particles have mass. But I dont want to be pigeonholed as that, because I dont want to put limits on what I plan to do in the future. Like, right now Im doing a lot of things that dont involve atomic particles or mass or anything like that. For example, my menswear line. Its a joint venture between me and Hugo Boss. Its going to be called either Higgs Boss or Hugo Boson. Or we may go a whole different way and call it H. Biggy. My branding team is into it right now. I havent been this excited about something Ive been involved in since I created the universe. Also, theres gonna be a fragrance. Theres been a lot written about tension in your relationship with Peter Higgs, one of the scientists who discovered you. Any truth to the rumors? Peter and I are both very passionate about what we do, and when you put a passionate human being and a passionate subatomic particle together theres bound to be friction. We fight like brothers sometimes, but its only because we care so deeply about what were doing and we want to make it perfect. But as far as what happened in the club last week, no, I did not throw a bottle at his head. O.K., be honest, and no false modesty here: Is there anything the Higgs boson cant do? A: Honest answer? I want to be considered the Michael Jordan of subatomic particles. By that I mean, Michael Jordan might not have been the most physically gifted player in the history of the N.B.A., but nobody worked harder at his game than he did. Thats what Im all about. Whether its giving mass to matter, breaking electroweak symmetry, or explaining the origin of the universe and whatnot, I believe I can do it all.

Carson said that as President, he would seek additional places to store grain, such as the hollowed-out heads on Mt. Rushmore. A nations greatness is measured by its ability to store grain, he said.

1," President Obama has sparked outrage in Congress and renewed calls for his impeachment by signing a daring Presidential memorandum that would pay workers enough to eat. The memorandum, which is based on the Presidents view that people should be paid for the hours they actually work, is shaping up as one of the most controversial and incendiary actions of his Presidency. House Republican leaders held a press conference this morning to warn Obama that, by advancing his agenda of paying people for the work they do, he is playing with political fire. A Presidential memorandum is a powerful tool and should be used sparingly, said House Speaker John Boehner (R-Ohio). It is not a vehicle for this President to enact his pet theories about people earning enough to survive. House Majority Leader Eric Cantor (R-Virginia) concurred, telling reporters, With one stroke of the pen, President Obama is removing the single greatest incentive for work: hunger. Apparently, President Obama needs a lesson in American history, he said. Hunger built the railroads. Hunger picked the crops. When the American people learn more about this action of the Presidents, they will see it for what it is: a hunger-killer. Photograph by Saul Loeb/AFP/Getty. ",2
1,"Opponents of Floridas Stand Your Ground law are attempting to mobilize support for a new law called Dont Shoot Me for Absolutely No Reason. The proposed law, which faces major opposition in the Florida legislature, would make it illegal for people in the state to shoot each other for no reason whatsoever. Under the provisions of Dont Shoot Me for Absolutely No Reason, you will be required to have an actual reason for shooting someone, said a spokesman for the measure, Harland Dorrinson. This will be a first in Florida. The controversial bill has already drawn the ire of the National Rifle Association, which issued a statement today saying that requiring someone to have a reason to shoot another person would violate the Second Amendment. If you force someone to have a reason to shoot someone, soon you will be taking away his right to shoot that person altogether, the N.R.A. said. We are not in principle against the idea of having a reason to shoot someone, the N.R.A. continued. But we believe you should be allowed to shoot the person first and have the reason second. Even if Dont Shoot Me for Absolutely No Reason somehow passes in the legislature, Florida Gov. Rick Scott said today that he would veto it, telling reporters, Making people in Florida have a reason to shoot each other would fundamentally change our way of life. ",2

In reality, this photo actually shows two brothers, The Amazing Branzottis, who were circus performers and Siamese twins connected at the mouth. Their popular sideshow act was hired to march in the parade as entertainment for the returning troops. 2. Migrant Mother The desperation and hopelessness of the Great Depression was effectively captured in this gritty image of a family down on their luckor was it? The photographer used clever framing to avoid showing that the mother at the center of the photo was actually sitting inyou guessed ita Dodge Viper. 3. The Cool Cigarette Friends This photo of three pals hanging out embodies old-school cool, but didnt it always seem odd that the Cigarette Friend on the far right wasnt smoking? The explanation is that he had just extinguished his spent cigarette by putting it in his mouth and then swallowing it, like the badass he was. 4. Einstein Sticking Out Tongue Albert Einstein spent his career calculating how subatomic particles behave, but until immigrating to the U.S., he never got a chance to taste an electron. This was the great physicists delighted reaction after licking a spoonful of pure electrons at the Princeton cafeteria. 5. Buzz Aldrin With U.S. Flag On Moon NASA was forced to subtly doctor this image when the Apollo 11 astronauts accidentally brought a banner that said Russia was here first to the moon instead of an American flag. Photo editors later corrected this error by altering it into the intended stars and stripes. 6. Afghan Girl Travelers in the wilderness of Afghanistan long claimed to catch glimpses of the fabled Afghan Girl, but photographic evidence of her existence was always blurry and dubious. Then, in 1984, a prankster fooled the world with this hoax photo, even reaching the cover of National Geographic before getting caught. Later, he revealed he faked Afghan Girl by taping a basketball to an umbrella. 7. A Nice Brunch Talk about being in the right place at the right time!

Unfortunately, shortly after this picture was shot, all the food was tragically eaten. 8.

To say that what followed this decision was a shitstorm would be a massive understatement.

As the Pope visits Washington, New York, and Philadelphia, people from every walk of life are expressing profound gratitude that the news media is offering non-stop coverage of Franciss every move instead of Trumps, if only for five days. Carol Foyler, of New York, said that the Popes visit would wreak havoc with traffic in Manhattan this week, but added, I would put up with that all year long if it meant seeing less of that [expletive] Trumps face. Even Americans who would not normally be expected to take an interest in the Popes visit, like agnostics and atheists, are wildly enthusiastic about the role Francis has played in momentarily ousting Trump from the headlines. I have never believed in God and I never will, said Harland Dorrinson, who is a Philadelphia-based atheist. Still, a miracle like a week without Trump kind of makes you think. Avram Heselstein, an Orthodox Jew, said he will join thousands of New Yorkers in Central Park, on Friday, to pay homage to the Pope. This isnt about being Jewish or Catholic, he said. This is about a man who just did something wonderful for everybody. Watch: In his first public appearance in New York, Pope Francis took part in evening prayers at St. Patricks Cathedral. ",2

1,"They dont pay taxes. They circumvent our laws. They get free stuff from the government. They are Americas billionaires, and many would like to see them gone. According to a new survey by the University of Minnesotas Opinion Research Institute, the American people hold the nations billionaires in lower esteem than ever before, and a majority would like to see new laws enacted to deport them. They come here, take thousands of our jobs, and export them overseas, one respondent said, in an opinion echoed by many others in the survey. They are part of a shadow economy that sucks billions of dollars out of the United States every year and puts it in Switzerland and the Caymans, another said. Images of hedge-fund managers arriving via helicopter in the Hamptons this summer have only reinforced the impression that authorities have turned a blind eye to their movements. Many of these people should be in prison, and the government is looking the other way, one respondent said. Stirring even more controversy is the billionaires practice of having babies in the United States and using the nations porous estate-tax laws to pass down untold wealth to the next generation. They should leave and take their children with them, one respondent said. Even after it is pointed out to respondents that some billionaires, such as Warren Buffett and Bill Gates, have made significant philanthropic contributions to the world, a majority of those polled stubbornly maintained their negative views of billionaires. Look, in every group youre going to have some good ones, one of the respondents said. But that doesnt take away from the fact that the vast majority of these people are destroying this country.

1,"It looks like love has won again! With its latest ruling, the Supreme Court has cemented its place in history by legalizing marriage between nine people who love each other very much. Yup. Barely hours into their first day back in session, the court passed the ruling, stating the rights provided to two people seeking marriage are inalienable, and should therefore be extended to groups of six men and three women who love and respect each other personally and professionally. Wow! Its truly a beautiful day to be alive. Coming on the heels of the courts ruling on same-sex marriage in June, the decision means that, for the first time, nine people will be able to consummate their love in a legally binding bond! Its an incredible step forward that many assumed theyd never see in their lifetime. Justice Anthony Kennedy wrote the stirring majority opinion, echoing the feelings of many who have long dreamed of this day: At last, the time has arrived for a group of people who have waited for years for this right. A group whose members might not always agree, but one that is built on a foundation of mutual respect and admiration. A group that has often deliberated long into the night, developing the kind of understanding and love that can only be forged through the nakedness of impassioned discourse and unbridled physical attraction. Goosebumps. Of course, not everyone was pleased with the ruling. Chief Justice John Roberts wrote the only dissent, voicing his concern that the court was overstepping its bounds: Regardless of the opinions of this court, I urge my colleagues to exercise restraint. If nine people are as deeply in love as I believe they are, there is no need to put a label on it. There is no constitutional basis for recognizing a group of nine partners as something more than that, despite how right it may feel. This is a matter best left up to the states. Yikes. Well, despite the chief justices protests, its still a day for the rest of America to celebrate love for everyone. Equality win! ",2
1,"President Obama is out of control. Since taking office seven years ago, hes hijacked our government and made an utter mockery of checks on his power. Hes off the rails, and today, the bleak reality is that if he wanted to, our sitting president could probably rob a Home Depot without even getting in trouble. Just consider the following scenario: President Obama heads to his local Home Depot in Arlington, VA, picks up a flatbed cart, and walks up and down the aisles flanked by Secret Service agents, piling his cart high with home-improvement items. Once His Majesty is finally satisfied, he pushes his haul right past the cashier, salutes the security camera, and walks right out the door. And who would be able to stop him? Is there anything standing between the president and Home Depots vast stock of high-quality construction tools and hardware? As unfathomable as it seems, we must face the truth: If the leader of the free world decided to raid one of Home Depots 2,200 national locations, he could likely do so at will, with no fear of punishment. When the Founding Fathers designed the presidency, surely they did not envision this. Surely they did not imagine a tyrant like Obama, who I suspect could point at a random Home Depot on a map, fly there in Air Force One, load hundreds of dollars worth of merchandise into a bulletproof limo without paying, and drive it all back to the White House in broad daylight. And yet here we are. Please, someone tell me, do we even live in a democracy anymore? Would dictatorship not be a more appropriate term for a system in which one man has unilateral power to commandeer thousands of kitchen and household appliances from the Home Depot? If tomorrow we see a topiary sitting proudly in the White House garden with its tag still attached, what could any of us do? Let this serve as a wake-up call. A president who can financially cripple Home Depot without fear of punishment is no president of ours! If and when this robber baron shows up on Home Depots doorstep expecting to rob it blind with no consequences, we will not stand for it. United we stand! ",2
1," The Presidential candidate Donald Trump blasted Pope Francis on Friday, arguing that the Pontiffs recent call to save the planet had largely overshadowed his far more reckless call to feed the poor. Look, if the Pope wants to spout off about climate change, thats his prerogative, I guess, Trump said. But when he starts talking about feeding the poor, that is totally dangerous and irresponsible. Every other candidate is ripping the Popes comments about climate change, he added. Im the only one in this race who seems to have noticed his truly crazy talk about feeding people. Trump said that, as President, it would be his job not to feed the poor but to keep them from getting into the country in the first place. We need to build a wall theyre too hungry to climb, he said. The reality-show host argued that the Pope should stay out of politics, saying, Lets face it, the guy is not rich. Ive been to the Vatican, he said. Its a nice enough place. But would you rather live there, or in a penthouse in Trump Tower? Not even close, my friend. ",2
1,"Republican critics of Obamacare rose up in anger today, claiming that, after two months of fixes, the healthcare.gov Web site is now unacceptably fast. Leading the howls of protest was the House Committee on Oversight and Government Reform chairman Darrell Issa (R-Calif.), who accused President Obama of designing a Web site that operates at a blistering, breakneck speed. With pages loading in milliseconds, this Web site is insuring people before they know what hit them, Rep. Issa charged. Clearly, this is what the President and his team had in mind. Additionally, Rep. Issa said, at such high speeds it is questionable whether this Web site is even safe for consumers to use, particularly the elderly. The California Republican said he would call for hearings this week to investigate the dangerous new velocity of healthcare.gov, telling reporters, If anyone can slow this thing down, its me. ",4
1,"Flush with victory from yesterdays statewide vote, supporters of North Carolinas Amendment One today moved forward with a bold proposal to ban electricity and soap. Cal Pinckton, a leading proponent of Amendment One who has helped craft the new law, says the principles behind it are simple: If the Bible doesnt mention something, its against the law, and the Bible makes no mention of either soap or electricity. He adds that North Carolina will still have plenty of stuff that the Bible does mention, like boils and locusts. While some critics of the proposed law said that it could be damaging to North Carolinas economy, since it would drive away fanciers of soap and electricity, Mr. Pinckton sees it differently. I think well see a huge boom in tourism, he says. North Carolina is on its way to becoming one great big old-timey theme park, like Colonial Williamsburg. But Mr. Pinckton is careful to emphasize that under the proposed law, there would be certain situations in which the use of electricity would be permitted: You could still use electricity for things that are explicitly mandated by the Bible, like transvaginal ultrasounds.

Twelve-year-old Trevor Gannett invited everyone in his middle school class to attend his birthday party, but none of the kids showed up. His mom posted images of the heartbroken child sitting alone, surrounded by his birthday cake and decorations, and asked people to help cheer him up. The images went viral and caught the attention of the U.S. military, and the very next day, all 1.4 million active-duty service members showed up to celebrate with Trevor! Incredible! Via Giphy.com Yup. Trevor opened his back door to see members from every branch of the armed forces standing in his backyard ready to wish him a happy birthday and eat ice cream cake! Members of the Army, the Navy, the Air Force, the Marine Corps, and even the Coast Guard arrived from all corners of the globe, from as nearby as Fort Lee in Virginia to as far away as Bagram Air Base in Afghanistan. Wow. Faith in humanity restored! From all accounts, Trevor had an absolute blast at his party. The Navy Brass Quintet played Happy Birthday, and Secretary of Defense Ashton Carter gifted him his very own Army Strong T-shirt. And after Trevor blew out the candles, he got a special treat: a flyover by 1,200 fighter jets100 for every year hes been alive! Looks like the greatest army in the world is also the kindest army.

1,"Moments after its conclusion on Sunday night, President Obamas speech about combating ISIS came under heavy criticism from people with zero better ideas. The Presidents proposals, ranging from coalition air strikes against ISIS to beefing up intelligence about potential terrorists, were blasted for being nothing new, with the harshest criticism coming from people with nothing new. I was incredibly frustrated hearing the President say he would destroy ISIS, New Jersey Governor Chris Christie told CNN. ISIS needs to be obliterated. Texas Sen. Ted Cruz shared Christies scathing assessment of Obamas speech. The President seems to think that ISIS will go away just by us bombing them, Cruz said. If I am President, I will bomb them so hard that will feel like they have been triple-bombed. Calling it too little, too late, Kentucky Sen. Rand Paul ripped the Presidents proposal for keeping potential terrorists from obtaining visas. We need to stop them before they even obtain the pens necessary to fill out visa forms, he said. Of all of the Republican Presidential candidates, the front-runner Donald Trump was perhaps the most withering in his criticism of the Presidents speech. I only heard the President use the word tough once, Trump said. I gave a speech last night and used it fifteen times. Pressed for specifics about how he would combat ISIS, Trump acknowledged that he had no new ideas, but added, My no new ideas will be much tougher than his no new ideas, you better believe it. ",2
1,"Republicans, who mercilessly mocked Barack Obamas lack of government experience before he became President, now favor Presidential candidates with no experience whatsoever, the head of the Republican National Committee has confirmed. The R.N.C. chief, Reince Priebus, said that he sees no contradiction at all between Republicans contempt for Obamas pre-White House rsum, which included eleven years spent in public office, and their rabid enthusiasm for G.O.P. rising stars Donald Trump, Ben Carson, and Carly Fiorina, whose combined years in public office total zero. I think what bothered us Republicans the most about Obama was that he was a community organizer, Priebus explained. What does organizing people have to do with running a government? In contrast with that dubious credential, he said, Carson is eminently qualified to be President because of his experience as a neurosurgeon. I think if Ben had negotiated with the Iranians we would have gotten a better deal, because he would have known how their brains worked, medically and all, Priebus argued. Additionally, the R.N.C. boss said that the billionaire Donald Trumps experience puts him leagues ahead of President Obama. One of President Obamas problems is that he is out of touch with reality, Priebus said. Donald Trump spent fourteen seasons hosting a reality show. As for the former Hewlett-Packard C.E.O. Carly Fiorina, Priebus said that the excitement her rsum is generating among the Republican faithful is totally understandable. Like a lot of Republicans, Id love to see Carly take on ISIS, he said. Shes shown she can destroy a large organization. Watch: Mary Norris explains the semicolon. ",2

1,"President Obamas proposal to give workers six weeks of paid leave is meeting strong opposition from a group of people who annually receive thirty-three weeks of paid leave. Members of the group heard the Presidents proposal on Tuesday night, one of the few nights of the year when they are required to report to their workplace. The opponents of paid leave, who show up for work a hundred and thirty-seven days per year and receive paid leave for the other two hundred and twenty-eight, were baffled by other moments in the Presidents speech. For example, they were confused by Obamas challenge to try to survive on a full-time job that pays fifteen thousand dollars, since they all currently hold a part-time job that pays a hundred and seventy-four thousand dollars.

1,"On July 1, recreational marijuana use was legalized in the state of Oregon. Stoners and casual users alike rejoiced at the news, and some even took to the streets, lighting up publicly in celebration. For supporters of legalization, this represented a major victory. But the battle may not be over just yet. Thats because, over at 1223 Marshall Street in the mid-size suburb of Beaverton, marijuana is still illegal. Thats right, Oregonians. Under Jim Michaelsons roof, youre in a pot-free zone. While Oregon law may allow you to have up to eight ounces of marijuana per household, Jim and Eileen Michaelson still have a zero-tolerance policy. This strict guideline is in effect even if its kept out of view or if youre able to get rid of the smell. In fact, sneaking around behind Jims back might even be worse than just doing it right in front of him. It doesnt matter whether the president or the queen of Timbuktu herself said pot is legal, read a statement from Jim Michaelson. When you step inside the Michaelson household, marijuana is absolutely not allowed. Yup. But not all hope is lost. Sources recently overheard Eileen Michaelson saying that medical marijuana could maybe be valuable, as long as its not being abused. Still, it seems like Jims most recent public comment reaffirmed that in his house, hes the mayor, and theres no room for any ifs, ands, or buts on the matter. So for now, it seems like anyone caught with marijuana in the Michaelson home will suffer some major consequences. And that goes for everyone. ",3
1,"The Republican front-runner, Donald Trump, said on Tuesday night that he was tremendously relieved that the recent controversy linking him to the Ku Klux Klan had apparently not hurt him with voters in Alabama. Im not a worrier by nature, but I must admit I was worried about this, Trump told reporters. The minute that that K.K.K. business started up, my main fear was, I sure hope this doesnt upset voters in Alabama. After the Alabama returns came in showing him romping to an easy victory in the Yellowhammer State, Trump said, I sighed a huge sigh of relief. Trump pointed to exit polls showing that ninety-seven per cent of Alabamans who voted for him were aware that he had been praised by the former K.K.K. leader David Duke and voted for me anyway. The fact that they knew I was endorsed by the K.K.K. but were able to look beyond it says something great about them, he said. I guess I was worried about nothing. ",2
1,"While heads of state debate how to handle the surge of Syrian refugees fleeing for their lives, ISIS continues its relentless campaign of violence and terror. Its most recent strike is a big one: This morning, U.S. military officials were stunned to discover that the Islamic terrorist group had placed the Pentagon up for auction on eBay. Disgusting. Initially set at $1,500, the price of the Pentagon quickly rose, rocketing past $7,000 in the first hour of open bidding. Troublingly, the White Houses attempts to outbid the competition $500 at a time have been continually thwarted as eBay users the world over escalate the situation. With two days still to go and no Buy It Now option, its anyones guess as to how high the bids could climb. As it is both the headquarters of the Department of Defense and a symbol of Americas military power, losing the Pentagon would be an absolutely devastating blow to the United States on many levels. Still, the White House has remained resolute in the wake of the attack, releasing the following statement earlier today: We condemn the attempted sale of the Pentagon as a despicable act of aggression against the United States. It will not go unanswered. America has never faltered in the face of extremism, and today is no exception. Please do not bid on the Pentagon. Time and again, ISIS has demonstrated that its cruelty is only rivaled by its ingenuity and adaptability. Even if the U.S. weathers this crisis, the next assault cant be far behind. ",2
1,"The landing of the Mars science rover Curiosity does not qualify as a significant scientific achievement and should not be getting so much of the publics attention, says the team of scientists who discovered the Higgs boson last month. People see these beautiful pictures from outer space and theyre inclined to think that something amazing has been achieved, a spokesperson for the Higgs-boson team said. Let the Mars rover do something of genuine value, like, say, discover how the universe was created. Then Ill be impressed. As for the NASA scientists behind the Mars rover, the Higgs-boson spokesman said, I dont think we should be too quick to use the word scientist here. Honestly, anyone can grow a Mohawk and put on a headset and look cool and all, but that hardly makes you a scientist. Lets see some of these dudes discover a particle or something along those lines. I mean, come on. From the Jet Propulsion Laboratory, in Pasadena, response to the Higgs-boson teams comments was swift and irate, as a NASA spokesman called the remarks an unacceptable diss. You know the difference between the Mars rover and the Higgs boson? said a NASA spokesman, his face red with anger. You can actually see the Mars rover. The NASA official went on to say that I can understand why the Higgs people think they found something thats real and all, but as far as I can tell their so-called boson is about as real as a leprechaun or a Smurf. In Geneva, the Higgs team was quick to fire back a response: At the Large Hadron Collider lab, were used to honest disagreements between scientists.

Speaking to supporters in Austin, Perry blasted the indictments and called for a return to an era of limited government that focusses on requiring gynecological procedures.

1,"Republican Presidential candidate Mitt Romney dropped by the selfnews today and gave what some are calling his most candid interview ever: Q: What do you see as the biggest challenge of your campaign going forward? A: Well, I suppose the biggest challenge would be the same one Ive faced all my life: that no one likes me. But as Ive found in the past, money usually takes care of that. Q: What do you need to do to persuade the right wing of your party that youre one of them? A: Well, first and foremost, I have to do a better job of convincing them that I believe in the crazy things they do. The problem is, the media keeps emphasizing aspects of my rsum that make me sound sane, like when I gave people in Massachusetts health care. Talk about something Id like to have a Mulligan on! Now, theres stuff in my biography that would help me with the Republican baselike the time in prep school when I pinned that gay boy to the ground and cut his hair offbut that gets little if any coverage. This is a clear case of media bias, and I wish it would stop. Q: How are you working to change the perception that youre sane? A: Well, obviously, by saying stuff that makes me sound like Im off my rocker. Sheldon Adelson has been super helpful with this. If I could just channel that guy, Id be ready for the booby hatch! I mean, you want to talk about a few bricks shy of a load. [Makes circular motion by the side of his head.] Anyway, hes given me some of my best lines for my stump speech. Like the one about how on Day One Im going to move Obamacare and Planned Parenthood to Iran and then bomb the hell out of all three. Thats pure Sheldon. Q: Speaking of your stump speech, recently youve been talking about how President Obama has fostered a culture of dependency. Whats the impetus behind that? A: Oh, thats to appeal to voters who dont like black people. I thought that was obvious! Laughing Out Loud. Well, Im afraid thats all I have time for. I have to take some of the old Bain gang out for dinner and make sure we keep our stories straight about when I worked there. ",2
1,"Republican lawmakers in the Texas State Senate are proposing a precedent-setting new bill that would make it illegal for women to live in the state. Senator Harland Dorrinson, one of the many pro-life lawmakers backing the woman ban, crafted his bill after witnessing Senator Wendy Davis filibuster an anti-abortion bill last month. That was our moment to say, Enough is enough, he said. This comes down to a choice between life and women, and we choose life. Senator Dorrinson said his bill would call for a twenty-foot woman-proof fence to be constructed along the borders of the state. Women are great at talking, but not at climbing, he observed. But another G.O.P. state senator, Cal Jamson, believes that the total ban on women goes too far and is proposing a less draconian bill that would allow some women to remain in the state as guest workers. Texas needs women to cook, clean, and cheerlead, he said. If they show that they can do those things and stay out of politics, there could be a pathway to citizenship. ",2

The researchers pored over black box recordings from nearly 1,000 downed flights looking for evidence of what caused the planes to crash.

The former Rhode Island governor, whose path to the White House was predicated on knocking Webb out of the race, could not contain his jubilation as he told supporters in Concord, New Hampshire, that his campaign is now solidly in the single digits. Accompanied by the blaring strains of the rock anthem More Than a Feeling, by Boston, Chafee served notice that he has only begun to fight. Were at two per cent now, but this is only the beginning, my friends, a pumped-up Chafee told his audience. The Chafee train has left the station, and the next stop is three per cent. Chafee told supporters that the next challenge he faces is overtaking the former Maryland governor Martin OMalley, whose standing in the new poll is a lofty four per cent. OMalley probably thinks I cant take him, but thats what Jim Webb thought, the pugnacious Rhode Islander said. Martin OMalley is going down! ",2

Because thanks to some intrepid social justice seekers, what was once a page dedicated to this antiquated and ignorant ideology has been absolutely torn to shreds. And frankly, its about time. It all started with one simple yet powerful edit, when a person changed the title of the page from Racism to Stop Racism. After that, the floodgates were open, and the edits started pouring in. People began changing every mention of the word slavery to read slavery is wrong. Then, every reference to the N-word was replaced with a new, more progressive version of the N-word: NO MORE RACISM.

For now, hes still trailing those two frontrunners in the polls, but after the revelation that his name is engraved in the famous Washington, D.C. memorial went public, hes been gaining some serious ground! Bush has been able to break away from the middle of the pack where he had appeared to be stuck, and is quickly closing in on third-place candidate Marco Rubio.

1,"The billionaire Koch brothers have approved a controversial plan to shoot cash from cannons directly at voters heading into polling places on Election Day. The plan, which Koch insiders have privately referred to as Operation Money Shot, would distribute as much as seventy million dollars in small bills in the hopes of seizing Republican control of the United States Senate next Tuesday. While most state laws prohibit electioneering within a hundred feet of polling places, the Koch plan craftily skirts that restriction by using high-powered cash cannons, similar to the T-shirt cannons used in sports arenas, which have a range of up to a hundred and fifty feet. According to a spokesman for the Kochs, Under the law, corporations are considered people, and people have always had the right to fire money from cannons at other people. When news of Operation Money Shot reached Democratic circles several weeks ago, there were howls of protest and threats of a legal challenge, as Democratic leaders complained that firing cash directly at voters about to cast their ballots would be a subversion of the election process. But the Supreme Court upheld the Koch brothers plan by a five-to-four vote on Thursday, arguing that spending money on elections was protected by the First Amendment, and that using a cannon was protected by the Second.

I am writing to you to set the record straight by explaining my finances in terms the American people can relate to. Lets say you bought a bottle of Chateau Lafite Rothschild 1982 for five thousand dollars. A couple of years later, what do you know, you sell that same bottle for ten thousand dollars. So you just made a profit of five thousand dollars through your own hard work. How much of that should you pay to the government? Id say fifteen per cent. Now lets say you have a fellow mowing the lawn at your seven-thousand-square-foot home in La Jolla, and he turns out to be an illegal. You say, No way, Jose (Jose is actually his real name) and send him packing. He doesnt deserve his full paycheck, since he lied to you in Spanish, but it wouldnt be fair to give him nothing, either. So you pay him fifteen per cent. Now lets pretend the United States of America is like one big restaurant. Not a fancy restaurant, mind you, but one that only gets two Michelin stars. And lets say that you order a meal of Beluga caviar, white truffles, and gold shavings, washing it down with your favorite beverage, Chateau Lafite Rothschild 1982. The bill arrives and its quite a hefty one for a working stiff who only made three hundred and seventy-five thousand dollars last year in speaking fees. (Thats right: minimum wage.) So when it comes to toting up the bill, how much should I tip the waiter, who, in case youre having trouble following this metaphor, is the I.R.S.? You got it: fifteen per cent. I think Ive now shown, using these real-life examples that everyone can relate to, that no one should ever pay more than fifteen per cent on their taxes. If you have been paying more than that, you should get rid of your loser accountant pronto. Thats another thing I have in common with regular Americans: we like firing people. Sonow that Ive laid it out in simple terms that even you can understand, do you agree that you and Mitt Romney have a whale of a lot more in common than you thought? Ill bet you ten grand you do.

After a week in which Alabama exhibited various displays of childishnessincluding kicking, screaming, stamping its feet, and threatening to hold its breaththe United States decided to take the extraordinary action of telling the hundred-and-ninety-five-year-old state to act its age. But any hopes that the United States order would be heeded were dashed when Alabama put its fingers in its ears and emitted a stream of monosyllabic nonsense sounds, claiming that the order had been rendered inaudible. That action may have only served to provoke the United States, which issued a subsequent statement characterizing the nations twenty-second state as nothing but a big crybaby.

That does not mean, however, that it has not been very much on our minds. As thousands have gathered in Lower Manhattan, passionately expressing their deep discontent with the status quo, we have taken note of these protests. And we have asked ourselves this question: How can we make money off them? The answer is the newly launched Goldman Sachs Global Rage Fund, whose investment objective is to monetize the Occupy Wall Street protests as they spread around the world. At Goldman, we recognize that the capitalist system as we know it is circling the drainbut theres plenty of money to be made on the way down. The Rage Fund will seek out opportunities to invest in products that are poised to benefit from the spreading protests, from police batons and barricades to stun guns and forehead bandages. Furthermore, as clashes between police and protesters turn ever more violent, we are making significant bets on companies that manufacture replacements for broken windows and overturned cars, as well as the raw materials necessary for the construction and incineration of effigies. It would be tempting, at a time like this, to say, Let them eat cake. But at Goldman, we are actively seeking to corner the market in cake futures. We project that through our aggressive market manipulation, the price of a piece of cake will quadruple by the end of 2011. Please contact your Goldman representative for a full prospectus. As the world descends into a Darwinian free-for-all, the Goldman Sachs Rage Fund is a great way to tell the protesters, Occupy this. We havent felt so good about something weve sold since our souls.

1,"The billionaire Donald Trumps proposal to ban Muslims from entering the United States has sparked deep disappointment among his supporters, many of whom had hoped he was planning to ban a sizable number of other religions. In conversations with likely Trump voters across the country, reactions ranged from disenchantment to a sharp sense of betrayal as supporters tried to make sense of his decision to ban members of only one faith. I heard him on TV talking about banning Muslims and I was kind of like, Is that it? said Carol Foyler, a Trump supporter from South Florida. I mean, banning Muslims is a good start, but I thought a smart businessman like him would be a lot more thorough. Harland Dorrinson, a Trump supporter from San Antonio, Texas, agreed. Saying youre only going to ban Muslims when there are so many other religious groups to ban just feels like politics as usual, he said. Ill give him a chance to explain himself on this one, but Id be lying if I said I didnt feel burned. But Tracy Klugian, a Trump supporter from Bismarck, North Dakota, said that voters who were upset with the billionaire for banning members of only one religion were freaking out over nothing. People need to understand that hes banning Muslims first because theyre the most obvious religious group youd want to ban, she said. Im sure once hes President hell get to all the other ones. ",2

In one camp is the Indiana Senate candidate Richard Mourdock, who says that his view that God is sometimes O.K. with rape is gaining real traction with a key demographic: men who dont like women very much. I cant tell you how many misogynists have come up to me at my rallies and said, Thank you for saying what you said, he told reporters today. I think theyre like, finally, someones taking a more nuanced position on rape. But in the other camp is the former New Hampshire governor John Sununu, who worries that the Republican Partys emphasis on misogyny is threatening to drown out its winning message of racism. I understand the appeal of Mourdocks anti-woman theme, but I worry that its going to overshadow our core value of racism, which is still our best shot at winning this thing, he said. In politics, youve got to dance with the one who brung you. Hoping to heal a possible rift with so little time left until Election Day, the R.N.C. chairman Reince Priebus said today that there is room for both views in todays Republican Party: Our big tent message to voters should be this: come for the misogyny, stay for the racism.

While Trump was previously thought to have a lock on the idiot vote heading into the Iowa caucuses, a recent surge by Senator Ted Cruz, of Texas, has put the idiots back in play. Cruz has worked tirelessly in recent weeks to tailor his message to undecided idiots, even revamping his stump speech to rid it of two-syllable words. Thats why Palin supporting Trump and not Cruz is such a win for us, the Trump aide said. Shes been out of politics for awhile, but she still has idiot cred. The aide said that no one should be surprised by the bond between Palin and Trump. Theyre both reality-show hosts, he said. And by lowering the bar in 2008, Palin singlehandedly made Trumps candidacy possible. But even as the Trump campaign staffers celebrate the Palin endorsement, they recognize that they still have their work cut out for them to secure victory in Iowa. Getting the idiots to support Trump is only half the battle, the aide said. Now we have to make sure that they make it to the caucuses without getting lost on the way.

1,"Flanked by members of his states legislature on Wednesday afternoon, Georgia Governor Nathan Deal proudly unveiled Georgias new official state slogan, We Make Florida Look Safe. Gov. Deal told reporters that the slogan was more than just words, reflecting Georgias determination to best its rival Florida for the nations most reckless gun law. When Florida passed Stand Your Ground, we knew we were playing catch-up, Gov. Deal said. Thanks to the fine men and women in the Georgia state legislature, were No. 1. Gov. Deal said he hoped that the states newly enacted Safe Carry Protection Act, which makes it legal to carry guns in bars, schools, churches, and some government buildings, would send the message that Georgia was taking its competition with Florida very, very seriously. In recent years, if you wanted to fire off a gun any damn place you pleased, there was a sense that Florida was the state for you, he said. Were hoping to change that perception. ",2
1,"President Obamas handling of controversies about the I.R.S., the Justice Department, and Benghazi has raised grave doubts about his ability to cope if he ever became involved in an actual scandal, prominent Republicans said today. If this is how he handles this stuff, Lord have mercy on him if he ever has to deal with a real scandal, said newly elected Rep. Mark Sanford (R-S. Carolina). Quite frankly, I dont think he has what it takes. The true test of a leader is this, Rep. Sanford added. When he gets in a fix, does he have the presence of mind to lie about his whereabouts? Sadly, I dont think President Obama passes that test. Mr. Sanfords concerns mirror those of another leading Republican lawmaker, Sen. David Vitter (R-Louisiana). If President Obama honestly thinks hes dealing with scandals right now, Im pretty sure he doesnt know what a scandal is, Sen. Vitter said. And thats very worrisome. When you get that three A.M. phone call, and its a reporter claiming that a prostitute said you like to dress up in a diaper, are you prepared for that call? Sen. Vitter said. In the case of President Obama, I am afraid that the answer is no. ",2
1,"A surprise appearance by the actor John Travolta today in Kievs Independence Square has further confused the situation in Ukraine, witnesses on the ground report. According to several accounts, Mr. Travolta flew to Ukraine in his self-piloted private jet in the hopes of raising morale in the embattled country, but only served to perplex Ukrainians with a brief but indecipherable speech. In his remarks, Mr. Travolta referred to Ukraine as Cranium and Crimea as IKEA before hopping back into his cockpit and flying away. The speech rattled the nerves of the Ukrainians who heard it, according to reports. In the words of one witness: We are no longer sure what country we are living in. ",2
1,"A new poll indicates that the American people are deeply disappointed in Hillary Clintons State Department e-mail flap because it does not live up to the high standards of sordidness set by Clinton scandals of the past. Davis Logsdon, who supervised the poll for the University of Minnesotas Opinion Research Institute, said that those surveyed were receptive and even intrigued by the idea of a new Clinton scandal, but then were deflated when they learned what the scandal actually involved. When people hear the words Clinton scandal, they expect a certain amount of sex and sleaze, Logsdon said. But once they find out that this one is about State Department e-mail regulations which may or may not have been disobeyed, they feel very let down. In a sense, the Clintons have created this problem for themselves, Logsdon added. They set an extremely high bar with some very memorable scandals in the past, and for a lot of people, this one just doesnt live up to the hype. The current scandal could be salvaged in the publics eye if some of Hillary Clintons e-mails turn out to have sexual content, but Logsdon called that a long shot. The poll results show that theres a genuine appetite out there for a juicy Clinton scandal, he said. But, sadly, theres also a sense that maybe they did their best work in the nineties. ",2
1," A new poll released Wednesday revealed that people rank President Barack Obama as the worst President since the Second World War, and also blame him for starting the Second World War. While the respondents slammed the President for his handling of the economy, Iraq, and a host of other issues, his perceived role as the primary cause of the Second World War was the biggest drag on his numbers. Even more troubling, when compared to the three leaders of the Axis powers during that war, President Obama polled at the bottom of the list, finishing far behind Emperor Hirohito of Japan. Fair or not, the American people hold the President responsible for starting the Second World War, Davis Logsdon, a political-science professor at the University of Minnesota, said. If the President hasnt gotten his version of the story out, theres only one person to blame for that: Barack Obama. In other poll results, the most popular President in the survey was Ronald Reagan, widely credited with ending the Second World War. ",4
1,"After Facebooks shares plummeted in after-hours trading today, Facebook C.E.O. Mark Zuckerberg issued the following personal letter to all nine hundred million Facebook users. Dear Facebook user: Hey its Mark. It seems like just yesterday that Facebook had its historic I.P.O. and, thanks to you, my net worth soared to a staggering $20 billion. What an awesome day that was for both of us. Today was a different kind of day. Facebook shares are plunging because the geniuses on Wall Street expect us to, and I quote, make money. Thats why your Facebook friend Mark needs your help. Facebook only makes money if people click on its ads. Do you know what Facebook ads are? Theyre those things on your Facebook page that you have never clicked on even once. But at Facebook were looking to change that. After doing extensive market research, we learned that there is one time when people actually do click on Facebook ads: when theyre drunk. This is the same business model that iTunes is based on. Im sure a few of you have had the experience of using Facebook late at night, only to wake up and find that youve gotten seven auto-insurance quotes or enrolled as a criminal-justice major at the University of Phoenix. Why am I sharing this information with you? Simple. If you want to save Facebookand I know that you doI need you to start drinking now. At Facebook headquarters, we like to have all-night coding parties where we get shitfaced and write algorithms and other computer stuff you wouldnt understand. I want you to do the same thing, except instead of coding, I want you to click on random ads for Ancestry.com and Christian Mingle, over and over and over again. You dont even have to buy anythingjust keep clicking. And drinking. Now, you might be asking yourself, Why do I have to help Mark out? Isnt Facebooks stock price his problem? Well, in a sense, yes. But maybe this is a good time to remind you that I have cached all of those photos you posted of yourself doing Jgerbomb jello shots at that Tri Delt party in 2007. And Ill bet your future employers would love to take a peek at them. Kthxbye Mark ",3
1,"In what is being hailed as a rare example of bipartisan coperation, Senate Democrats and Republicans came together today on a near-unanimous vote to defund Sen. Ted Cruz (R-Texas). The measure, which shuts down all nonessential functions of Sen. Cruz, passed by a margin of ninety-nine to one. As the final vote was announced this morning, Sen. Cruzs microphone was unplugged and the Senate exploded with cheers on both sides of the aisle. Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid (D-Nevada) said that the vote to defund the Texas senator showed that bipartisan coperation is possible even in the usually rancorous Senate: Every now and then the two parties can reach across the aisle and find something that we both despise with all our might. Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Kentucky) acknowledged that the budget impact of defunding Sen. Cruz would be minimal, but added, This was never about money. We got Ted Cruz to stop talking, and you cant put a price tag on that. ",2
1,"The United States government charged former intelligence analyst Edward Snowden with spying on Friday, apparently unaware that in doing so it had created a situation dripping with irony. At a press conference to discuss the accusations, an N.S.A. spokesman surprised observers by announcing the spying charges against Mr. Snowden with a totally straight face. These charges send a clear message, the spokesman said. In the United States, you cant spy on people. Seemingly not kidding, the spokesman went on to discuss another charge against Mr. Snowdenthe theft of government documents: The American people have the right to assume that their private documents will remain private and wont be collected by someone in the government for his own purposes. Only by bringing Mr. Snowden to justice can we safeguard the most precious of American rights: privacy, added the spokesman, apparently serious. ",3
1,"In the battle against ISIS, the U.S. just scored perhaps its biggest symbolic victory yet. According to Col. Steven Warren, a spokesman for the U.S.led coalition against the Islamic State, the man widely known as the Umpire of ISIS was likely killed late last week in a targeted drone strike. A powerful public figure in the militant group, the Umpire of ISIS was a frequent and chilling presence in its brutal propaganda videos, stooping silently in the background in full umpire gear as hostages were executed. We are reasonably certain that we killed our intended target, who was a major tactical figure in ISIS recruiting efforts, Col. Warren said in a statement. We definitely killed an umpire. Hopefully, well get confirmation soon that this was 100 percent our guy. U.S. military intelligence officials say they were alerted to the Umpire of ISIS location by a resident of the ISIS-occupied city of Raqqa who saw the famed militant standing motionlessly in the courtyard of a rumored jihadi safehouse for eight uninterrupted hours. A U.S. senior commander authorized a drone strike shortly thereafter, and the next morning, a surveillance satellite was able to procure a distinct image of a mangled umpire mask amidst the rubble, all but confirming that the U.S. Hellfire missiles had succeeded in hitting their target. While the Umpire may have only been one ISIS member out of tens of thousands, he was a prominent symbol of the groups public image, and his death will hopefully serve as a crushing blow to the terrorist groups morale.

1,"Two days after the release of an unusually strong jobs report, prominent Republicans appeared on the Sunday morning talk shows to question President Obamas suspicious motives for repairing the economy. When there have been so many months of job growth, it does make you wonder what hes up to, said Sen. Ted Cruz (R-Texas). You add in the rising stock market and falling gas prices, and the whole thing doesnt pass the smell test. Appearing on Fox News, Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell accused the President of cynically fixing the economy to distract the American people. This country faces serious problems, and I dont think they can be swept under the rug by creating prosperity, he said. But the sternest rebuke came from House Speaker John Boehner, who warned, If President Obama doesnt stop fixing the economy, Congress has ways to make him stop. If the President thinks he can fool the American people by putting them back to work and raising their wages, hes headed for a rude awakening, he said. ",2
1,"With six fingers of Johnnie Walker swirling in his favorite tumbler, John Boehner speaks with the quiet assurance of a man on the brink of something big. Just three workdays remain until Congress packs it in for 2013, and the House that Boehner presides over is about to set the record for the least productive year in its historya quixotic goal that the tawny Ohioan set for himself when he arrived in Washington, in 1991. Like most of us, I came to this town hoping to make history, he says, refilling his tumbler. And, damn it, thats what Im about to do. Downing his glass in one gulp, he reflects upon all the little things that had to go right to make the year of epic underachievement possible. There were the Benghazi hearings, of course, and all the votes to repeal Obamacare, he says. But when we shut down the government in the fall, I started thinking, Jesus, the recordit could happen. During those heady shutdown days, Boehner didnt dare speak about the record he had long dreamed of settingdidnt want to jinx anythingbut with Congresss work year set to end on Friday, he now admits, Im so close I can taste it. Yesterday, when members of his caucus came up with a bipartisan budget deal, Boehner had a little come-to-Jesus meeting with them, he says. I told them, Ive worked too long and hard for this record, damn it. Dont mess it up at the last minute by accomplishing something. So with the record for worst Congress seemingly in the bagI can cross that off my bucket list, he sayswhat does John Boehner do for an encore? Its going to be tough to make next years Congress even worse, he says, pouring himself another tall one. But its going to be fun trying. ",2
1,"Youve probably seen a lot of eerily similar celebrity doppelgngers on the internet, but Nicholas Gifford takes it to a whole other level. One glance at his face and its obvious that he looks exactly like the War Rig from Mad Mad: Fury Road! Youre probably thinking that Nicholas set out to mimic Imperator Furiosas battle truck, but nope, its just a bizarre coincidence. If you check out his Facebook page, you can tell that hes appeared this way at least as far back as 2004, when he joined the social media site, a full 11 years before Fury Road hit theaters. For all we know, Nicholas hasnt even seen Mad Max yet and is confused when strangers shout What a lovely day! at him. According to his LinkedIn, Nicholas is currently employed as a warehouse manager at Staples. But if he ever gets tired of that profession, he could probably line up a steady gig taking photos with people on the convention circuit. What movie fan wouldnt shell out $20 to snap a pic with Mr. Rig himself? Director George Miller, if youre putting a truck in the next Mad Max sequel, weve got three words for you: Cast this man! ",3
1,"President Obama is about to issue an executive order that would force all Americans to purchase a monthly supply of marijuana, the Fox News Channel reported today. According to Foxs Sean Hannity, who broke the story, Obamas initiative is part of a broader plan to make weed available and affordable to every individual in the United States. Under Obamas plan, every American would be required to purchase a government-mandated amount of marijuana per month or face a penalty of up to two thousand dollars. Hannity said that the President hopes to have the mandatory marijuana plan up and running by 2015, but theyre still working on the Web site. Appearing on Fox, House Speaker John Boehner (R-Ohio) took issue with Obamas recent remark that marijuana was no more dangerous than alcohol: I saw that as an insult. ",2
1,"There are growing fears among supporters of the Republican Presidential candidate Donald Trump that his new focus on Muslims is distracting him from his campaign against Mexicans. After the billionaire said he would consider shutting down mosques if he were President, supporters expressed concern that such signature proposals as a wall with Mexico and mass deportations were being lost in the shuffle. Carol Foyler, who viewed a recent Trump appearance on television, said that she was alarmed to hear him talk about closing mosques without mentioning the wall with Mexico even once. I just worry, I guess, that with all of this talk about Muslims hes really forgetting about Mexicans, she said. It feels kind of like a bait-and-switch. Another Trump supporter, Harland Dorrinson, agreed. Shutting down the mosques is a great idea, sure, but he shouldnt do that if its going to divert resources from forcibly deporting eleven million immigrants, he said. I would be very sad to see that happen. But Tracy Klugian, a die-hard Trump volunteer who is working for his campaign in Iowa, called such criticism of her candidate misguided. You dont get to be a successful businessman like Donald Trump without being able to multitask, she said. Watch: Comma Queen Mary Norris discusses grammatical uses of I and me. ",2
1,"Presidential candidate Donald Trump revealed a little-known episode of personal heroism from his youth on Saturday, telling an Iowa audience that he narrowly avoided capture in Vietnam by remaining in the United States for the duration of the war. The Cong were after me, Trump said, visibly stirred by the memory. And then, just in the nick of time, I got my deferment. The former reality-show star said he had never shared his record as a war hero before because I dont like to boast. He said that he only disclosed the episode now because the way this nation treats our deferment veterans is a disgrace. Trump complained that he received no official commendation or medal for his heroism, calling the lack of recognition shameful. Those brave Americans who, like me, avoided being captured by not serving at allwe are the true heroes, he said. Trumps tale of valor appeared to move many members of his audience, some of whom waited in line after his speech to thank him for his lack of service. ",2

Calling us crazy assholes is insulting, derogatory, and beneath contempt, House Speaker John Boehner told reporters. And now if youll excuse me, ladies and gentlemen, I have to go sue Obama. Determined to burnish their reputation as extremely sane people who are not assholes at all, House Republicans in their lawsuit accuse the President of coldly and arrogantly seizing power granted to him by the United States Constitution. The lawsuit alleges that having signed 181 executive orders to date, Barack Obama seems intent on chasing the records of such notorious renegades as Dwight Eisenhower (484) and Theodore Roosevelt (1,081).

At a hastily called press conference this afternoon, the Texas Governor made an emotional appeal to Washingtonians who might be disappointed by the sudden suspension of executions in their state: Come to Texas. The death penalty is alive and well here. Blasting Governor Inslee, he reassured Washington residents that if they move to Texas, as God is my witness, no one will ever take your death penalty away from you.

We Republicans have worked long and hard to develop insidious racial code words like entitlement society and personal responsibility, said Sen. Rand Paul (R-Kentucky). There is no excuse for offensive racist comments like the ones Cliven Bundy made when there are so many subtler ways of making the exact same point. Fox News also blasted the rancher, saying in a statement, Cliven Bundys outrageous racist remarks undermine decades of progress in our effort to come up with cleverer ways of saying the same thing.

1,"The race for the White House will most likely be wide open after Hillary Clinton serves her two terms as President, experts agree. What happens in 2024 is anyones guessand if anyone tells you differently, theyre lying, says political science professor Davis Logsdon of the University of Minnesota. The only thing we can say with any certainty is that Hillary Clinton will be elected President by a landslide in 2016 and relected by an even bigger margin in 2020. Mr. Logsdon says that possible Republican Presidential candidates in 2024 could include Wisconsin Congressman Paul Ryan, Louisiana Governor Bobby Jindal, and former Florida Governor Jeb Bush, with this caveat: If any of those men have the misfortune of running against Hillary in 2016 or 2020, she will defeat them so soundly that their political careers will be finished and they will vanish from public life forever. As for the future of the Democratic Party after Hillarys two terms are over, Mr. Logsdon offers this prediction: I can tell you right now that Hillarys Presidency will be so successful that she will usher in a Democratic dynasty of sorts. Im not a betting man, but if I had to guess, Id say that after eight years of Hillary there will be eight years of Michelle, then eight years each for Chelsea, Sasha, and Malia. But not so fast, says Democratic strategist Tracy Klugian, who believes such predictions sell Hillary short: Assuming her current poll numbers hold up in 2024, I think its safe to say that Hillary Clinton will be the most popular President in U.S. history. In that event, the Twenty-second Amendment, which limits the President to two terms, will be repealed and Hillary will run again. Mr. Logsdon, however, scoffs at that scenario: If the Twenty-second Amendment is repealed, Bill will run again. ",2
1," President Obama is under increasing pressure to work closely and coperatively with a group of people who are suing him in federal court, the people suing him confirmed today. Over the past six years, President Obama has been stubborn, arrogant, and oppositional, John Boehner, the Republican Speaker of the House, said. His refusal to work with people who are suing him is just the latest example. Republican Senator Mitch McConnell, of Kentucky, echoed the Speakers criticism, adding, Time and time again, the President has refused to pick up the phone and talk to me, despite my saying that I was doing everything in my power to make him a one-term President. Other members of the G.O.P. caucus blasted the President for being aloof and frosty to Republicans who had questioned his American citizenship, the authenticity of his birth certificate, and the legitimacy of his Presidency. Thats no way to get things done, Senator James Inhofe, of Oklahoma, said. Hes got a real attitude. Boehner concluded his comments, however, with an olive branch of sorts for Obama. Mr. President, we Republicans are eager to sit across the table from you and get to work for the American people, he said. Otherwise, get ready to be impeached. ",2
1,"Former Alaska Governor Sarah Palin continued to air her grievances against President Obama on Friday, telling an audience at a Trump rally in Iowa that Obama was single-handedly to blame for her defeat in the 2008 general election. Like a lot of American families, we Palins had big plans and dreamsin this case, regarding me becoming Vice-President, she said. But you know who had to go and ruin those plans and dreams? President Obama. Palin said that Obama insured her defeat in 2008 just like he has defeated so many other great Americans, and that her family had paid the price. I cant help thinking that, if I had been elected Vice-President, Bristol and Willow wouldnt have gotten into that drunken brawl and Track wouldnt have threatened his girlfriend and whatnot, she said.

1,"Even before he was old enough to lift a racket, 10-year-old Jonathan Greene fell in love with the game of tennis, idolizing world champion Serena Williams most of all. So when Jonathan was diagnosed with a rare autoimmune disease, his family reached out to the tennis superstar in hopes of arranging a phone call to lift the boys spirits. But to everyones surprise, Serena Williams responded in a much bigger way: She promised to grunt Jonathans name every time she hits a tennis ball this year. Simply beautiful. After hearing Jonathans story, Williams announced in a post-match interview that she would honor this brave young fan by grunting Jonathan! whenever she strikes a tennis ball. That means not just once every match, or just once every point, but every time her racket makes contact with a ball for the remainder of the season! Jonathan didnt have to wait long. Williams just put her plan into action at a recent exhibition match, grunting Jonathans name on every serve, volley, and groundstroke of her 6-2, 6-0 victory over Germanys Carina Witthoeft, including a 32-shot baseline exchange that had fans on their feet. At one point, Williams even shouted Jonathan! at the line judge to officially challenge a cross-court volley that was mistakenly called wide. Wow. What a world-class gesture. And its only just the beginning, as Williams confirmed that she intends to grunt Jonathans name on every shot of each of the three remaining Grand Slams of 2016, beginning with the French Open in May. Nothing warms our hearts like seeing celebrities use their influence to do something good. Other players better start taking notes; this is how you give back to a fan in need. ",2

The C.I.A. rushed to produce the brochure after it became clear that as many as one in three Americans may have some involvement in the Petraeus affair. And with the scandal widening every day, a lot of average folks out there are worried that they might somehow be involved in it without knowing, says Carol Foyler, director of the C.I.A.s public-information office. This booklet should clear up a lot misunderstandings. The booklet includes a simple, user-friendly checklist that should help people determine whether they are at risk for being implicated in the scandal, she says. Have you ever met David Petraeus? Have you ever received and/or sent shirtless photos of an F.B.I. agent? Have you ever exchanged e-mails with Jill Kelley? Under five thousand pages of e-mails and youre probably O.K., but anywhere between ten thousand and fifteen thousand pages of e-mails could potentially mean youre involved in some way, she says. Defense Secretary Leon Panetta said today that he expected the Petraeus scandal to wind down by early 2015 but would not commit to an official timetable. ",3
1,"A rally featuring a racist speaker Friday night in Mobile attracted a crowd of just twenty thousand people, widely considered a disappointing turnout for a racist event in Alabama. According to racist event planners in the state, a crowd of twenty thousand would rank the event as one of the smaller racist rallies in Alabama this year. Organizers of the rally were quick to defend the size of the turnout. There is always a lot of competition for the racist audience in Alabama, an aide to the speaker said. There were other racists speaking at other venues in the state Friday night. Plus, a lot of racists now prefer to stay at home and stream racist content on the Internet. Given all the options available to racists, I think twenty thousand is a solid number. Harland Dorrinson, a longtime racist event planner in Alabama, disagreed, claiming that the size of the crowd was more reminiscent of non-racist events in the state. You go around spewing hatred every chance you get, and then you only draw twenty thousand in Alabama? he said. The people who organized this event need to sit down and figure out what went wrong.

1,"Dear American Person: As many of you know, in recent days my opponent has spread the rumors that 1) I have refused to make my tax returns public and 2) I have hidden my money in bank accounts in Switzerland and the Caymans. These two rumors, while true, have made me look very bad. So I thought I would take this opportunity to explain my finances in terms even a poor person could understand. Lets say you met the love of your life, and you wrote her a series of passionate love letters. In these letters, you told her how you intended to protect her, cherish her, and always keep her safe. And then lets say somebody went and told you that you had to make those love letters available for the world to see. If youre even half the man I am, youd say, Heck no. Well, in my case, the love of my life is my money. (If you dont believe me, ask Ann.) And my tax returns are like my love letters to my money, detailing the lengths to which Ill go to keep my precious money from being taken away from me. If you think I should make those love letters public, then Im sorry, my friend, but you dont believe in love. Now, lets say you asked the love of your life to marry you, and youre fortunate enough that she said yes. Should someone be able to force you to spend your honeymoon in a ratty room at some Motel 6, where God knows what crackheads and whores slept before you? Or should you be allowed to take your bride to a five-star Swiss chateau, perhaps, or an exclusive beach on Grand Cayman? I think you can see where Im going with this. In conclusion: if refusing to release my tax returns and having foreign bank accounts is wrong, I dont want to be right. I did it all for love. And as your President, I promise I will never, ever come between you and the thing you love. Unless youre gay. (Laughing Out Loud.) Vote for me, Mitt Romney ",2
1,"With U.S. Presidential elections now costing more than five billion dollars, there must be a cheaper way to find the worst people in the country, experts believe. According to Davis Logsdon, a political scientist at the University of Minnesota, the United States could use current technology to find the nations most reprehensible people at a fraction of the five-billion-dollar price tag. Any search for the worst people in the country should logically begin one place: on Twitter, said Logsdon, who recommends scouring the social network for users who consistently show signs of narcissistic-personality disorder, poor impulse control, and other traits common to odious people. Once a comprehensive list of those Twitter users is compiled, Logsdon said, it could be cross-referenced with a database containing the names of people who have presided over spectacular business failures, have been the target of multiple ethics probes, or are currently under indictment for a broad array of criminal offenses. After we crunch the numbers and find the twelve or so worst people in our database, we could then put them on television to demonstrate just how awful they are as people, said Logsdon, who noted that that part of the current system works very well. All in all, Logsdon believes that his method for finding the nations worst people would cost practically nothing, leaving five billion dollars left over to help rebuild the nations schools, roads, and other crumbling infrastructure. The political scientist expects to encounter significant resistance to his proposal, however. Its hard to imagine a new system finding worse people than our current one does, he admitted.

1,"Supporters of the United States twelve-year quagmire in Afghanistan cheered the news today that the U.S. would strive to achieve a seamless transfer of that quagmire to Syria, effective immediately. Army Gen. Martin Dempsey, the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, sought to reassure those who were concerned that the U.S. withdrawal of troops from Afghanistan signalled a wavering of the nations commitment to being mired in open-ended military muddles. I can tell you, right here and right now, that the U.S. is every bit as determined to engage in an ill-defined, ill-advised and seemingly interminable mission in Syria as we were in Afghanistan, Gen. Dempsey said. All thats changing is the Zip Code. General Dempsey said that the same tribal hatreds, sectarian violence, and untrustworthy alliances that made Afghanistan a quicksand-like morass are very much in evidence in Syria: I am confident that we could be involved in Syria for many, many years before figuring out why we are there. Harland Dorrinson, executive director of the National Quagmire Institute, a think tank dedicated to promoting the United States involvement in intractable conflicts around the globe, said he found General Dempseys words about Syria reassuring: I felt a lot better after hearing what he had to say, and I know a lot of defense contractors felt the same way.

1,"Sen. Ted Cruz (R-Texas) blasted his Democratic colleagues in the Senate on Thursday, telling reporters, Im sick and tired of people blaming George W. Bush for things he did. In the aftermath of the release of the Senate Intelligence Committees report on torture, Cruz said, Democrats have been busy with their favorite game again: bringing up catastrophic things that President Bush did and then blaming him for them. The Texas Senator raised the invasion of Iraq as an example of something that Bush gets blamed for simply because he did it. Just because President Bush ordered the invasion of Iraq, costing thousands of lives and trillions of dollars, does that mean he should bear the blame for it? he asked. America is not a place where you get blamed for things simply because they never would have happened unless you did them. He urged each of his Democratic colleagues to look in the mirror and ask yourselves whether you want to be blamed for disasters you have personally created? In my case, the answer is a resounding no.

1,"Tempers flared in the aftermath of Thursday nights Republican debate, as rival candidates accused the billionaire Donald Trump of failing to back up his misogynist slurs with concrete and workable anti-woman proposals. Florida governor Jeb Bush and Wisconsin governor Scott Walker led the charge, as both of them asserted that Trumps sexist rhetoric paled in comparison with their own strong records of opposition to womens rights. As governor of Florida, I defunded Planned Parenthood, Bush said. Donald Trump is good at creating misogynist sound bites, but Ive actually rolled up my sleeves and gotten things done. Governor Walker piled on, touting his own anti-woman achievements during his time in office. In Wisconsin, I used my power as governor to repeal a law supporting equal pay for women, he said. No offense to Mr. Trump, but nothing on his rsum compares with that. The attacks by Trumps rivals seemed to sting the hotheaded billionaire, who hit back hard on Friday. When it comes to coming up with solid anti-woman solutions, I do not intend to be lectured by Jeb Bush and Scott Walker, he said, noting that the wall he intends to build on the border with Mexico would keep out many women.

1,"Rejecting calls to boycott Arizona, a newly formed gay organization is mobilizing its members to move to the state by the millions in the hopes of transforming it into the nations first majority gay state. The group, called Americans for a Gay Arizona, has already received commitments from a million gay Americans to move to the state within the next two months, with a target of enlisting over six million gays to move there by the end of the year. Harland Dorrinson, the executive director of the group, said that the influx of six million gays would be more than enough to insure that Arizona would be majority gay, but he acknowledged that he did not have an exact figure of how many gays currently reside there. We think it could be as many as a million, he said. But if you add in conservative politicians, that number could go much higher. According to one associate of Governor Jan Brewer, the plan to move six million gays to Arizona is shaping up to be the governors worst nightmare. Shes always been against immigration, but nothing like this, the associate said. ",2
1,"Hes only got until January 20, 2017, and POTUS is going to make every second count. 1. Sneak a couple hot damns! into the Pledge of Allegiance: He might have to call in a couple favors to make it happen, but itll undoubtedly be worth it. 2. Get the pilot to roll Air Force One: He has been begging and begging for years now, but so far, to no avail. Expect a final all-or-nothing push from the president on this matter in his last 100 days. 3. Chop the head off the snake that keeps killing birds on the White House lawn: Obamas tenure as president might be nearing its end, but that doesnt mean he wont do everything in his power to take a shovel to the snake that keeps leaving a feathery mess outside his door. Given his determination, the president should have it mounted on his wall well before he leaves office. 4. Get all the Kennedy bones out of the White House bowling alleys ball return: High on Obamas perpetually deferred to-do list has always been to get into the machinery of the White Houses bowling alley and jimmy out the bones of Rosemary, Kathleen, and Joseph Jr., which have all gotten lodged in there at different times during his predecessors terms. Hopefully, his final year in office will finally give him the flexibility to do so. 5. Complete the White House Challenge: One hundred thirty-two rooms. One hundred thirty-two shots. Few presidents have successfully completed the White House Challenge, but Obamas gonna give it a go sometime before he leaves office. 6.

1,"President Barack Obama was totally furious he spent a week of his time posing for a trillion-dollar platinum coin that would never be minted, a White House source confirmed today. The President is a super-busy man, so its understandable that hed be mad, the source said. Its not like he has time to sit still for hours on end for a coin thats not going to happen. Mr. Obama devoted much of last week to posing for the trillion-dollar coin on the assurances of outgoing Treasury Secretary Timothy Geithner, who told Mr. Obama that the coin had a way better than fifty percent chance of being minted. Based on Mr. Geithners advice, Mr. Obama carved hours out of his schedule to pose for the ill-fated coin, even cutting short meetings with world leaders such as Afghan President Hamid Karzai. But even as he posed for it, Mr. Obama seemed fidgety and skeptical that the platinum coin would ever see the light of day. He was like, Look, Ive got things to do. Is this coin really going to happen, because if not, this whole thing is really messed up, the source said. When Mr. Geithner delivered the news to the President that the coin idea had been scrapped, according to the source, to say that things got ugly would be a massive understatement. The coin fiasco behind him, Mr. Obama has now apparently learned his lesson, the source said: If this coin idea ever comes up again, hes going to make Biden pose for it. ",2
1,"Stating that their continuing hostilities are a threat to world peace, Iran has offered to mediate talks between congressional Republicans and President Obama. Irans Supreme Leader, Ali Khamenei, made the offer one day after Iran received what he called a worrisome letter from Republican leaders, which suggested to him that the relationship between Republicans and Obama has deteriorated dangerously. Tensions between these two historic enemies have been high in recent years, but we believe they are now at a boiling point, Khamenei said. As a result, Iran feels it must offer itself as a peacemaker. He said that his nation was the logical choice to jumpstart negotiations between Obama and the Republicans because it has become clear that both sides currently talk more to Iran than to each other. He invited Obama and the Republicans to meet in Tehran to hash out their differences and called on world powers to force the two bitter foes to the bargaining table, adding, It is time to stop the madness. Hours after Iran made its offer, President Obama said that he was willing to meet with his congressional adversaries under the auspices of Tehran, but questioned whether any deal reached with Republicans is worth the paper its written on. For their part, the Republicans said they would only agree to talks if there were no preconditions, such as recognizing President Obamas existence. ",4
1," Just hours after Senator Ted Cruz (R-Texas) told CNN that he had no choice but to sign up for Obamacare, President Barack Obama signed an executive order making Cruz ineligible for coverage under the Affordable Care Act. Clearly, the hardship of receiving Obamacare was causing Ted a great deal of pain, the President said. This should take care of that. Obama acknowledged that the executive order, which makes Cruz the only American expressly forbidden from signing up for Obamacare, was an extraordinary measure, but added, I felt it was a necessary humanitarian gesture to protect Ted from the law he hates. Even as he signed the order, the President said that he was torn about barring Cruz from coverage, stating,Hes definitely someone who would benefit from seeing a doctor. In an official statement released later in the day, Cruz blasted the executive order and accused Obama of distorting his position on Obamacare: I never said I didnt want to have it. I said I didnt want everyone else in the country to have it. ",2

1,"The White Houses attempt to portray President Obama as a gun user may have had unintended consequences today, as a newly released photo of Mr. Obama firing a rifle at Camp David set off a panic of gun buying across the U.S. Right-wing opponents of Mr. Obama were behind the frenzied gun sales, saying that they were terrified by the image of an armed and shooting President. I dont want to sound paranoid or anything, but now everything Obama has been doing makes sense, said Harland Dorrinson, who was waiting on a blocks-long line outside a West Virginia Wal-Mart. He wants to take away all our guns and then hes going to come shoot us. Learning that Mr. Obama only uses his rifle for skeet-shooting did little to calm Mr. Dorrinson: Somebody owning a gun just for sporting purposes? Yeah, right. In an effort to stem the panic, White House spokesman Jay Carney told reporters today that skeet-shooting took up relatively little of the Presidents time at Camp David, and that his favorite leisure activities were actually badminton and frisbee. The White House later released a photo of Mr. Obama putting away his gun and never using it again. Get The selfnews delivered to your inbox. Photograph by Pete Souza. ",2
1,"Life hasnt been easy for Donald Trump. Though hes only 6 years old, hes already faced a lifetime of hardship as the result of a rare terminal disease that has left him in hospitals for much of his young life. With disturbingly yellow skin pigmentation, a prematurely deepened voice caused by thyroid abnormalities, and a grotesquely enlarged head due to cerebrospinal fluid accumulation, he will never have a chance at a normal childhood. And, sadly, doctors believe that he wont live much longer. But Donald doesnt want you to feel sorry for him. Nope. What he really wants is for you to vote for him. Believe it or not, little Donald is running for president of the United States, and thanks to thousands of kindhearted people around the country who are committed to helping him live out his dream, hes been making a big splash on the campaign trail. When we heard about Donnys wish, we knew we had to come together and make it happen, said Jonathan Grusin, one of thousands of Americans who has pulled out all the stops to help make Donalds dream a reality. If going to a rally or telling a pollster that Id vote for him in the 2016 election makes his day even a little brighter, Im happy to do it. It just feels like the least I could do for a little boy whos been so, so brave, added Grusin. So, on June 16, Donaldwearing a suit and a red tie, just like a real politicianofficially announced his candidacy in a long and delightful speech, in which he laid out his vision for the country. He said that he wanted to build a giant wall around the U.S. to keep the bad guys out, and he expressed a desire to build bridges that are bigger than the big bridges they have in China. He also revealed that he knew how to beat ISIS, and he promised to make America better and stronger than ever. Within days, word of Donalds presidential ambitions spread throughout the country, and soon people everywhere were volunteering their time to support the young politico. In the weeks since, the enthusiastic first-grader has been giving speeches almost every single day, and people have been turning out by the dozens to hear his fun and simple ideas for how to make our country better. Hes even got to go on TV a few times, including for a special one-on-one interview with Fox News pundit Sean Hannity! Faith in humanity restored! Although Donald is trying his best to prove he can hold his own against the grown-up candidates, sometimes he just cant help but be a kid. His charmingly juvenile Twitter feed is chock-full of elementary-school insults and hilarious exaggerations that could only come from the mind of a child. A very, very special child. But we have to say that for a 6-year-oldespecially one battling such a horrible diseasewe think that Donald is doing a pretty awesome job. And while he might not ever make it to the Oval Office, hell always be the commander-in-chief of our hearts. So look out, Washington: Donald Trump is coming to shake things up! ",2
1,"Sometimes, it takes a few teenagers to show adults the difference between right and wrong. Thats exactly what happened in Sedalia, MO last week. When the city council blocked plans to allow a mosque to be built in town, a group of high schoolers came together and offered to let local Muslims use the storage unit they have sex in. Faith in humanity restored! After the crushing setback for their mosque, Sedalia Muslims didnt have to wait long for the incredible group of high schoolers to come to their defense in the most amazing way possible. Everyone deserves the right to worship, and we were more than happy to give up our storage unit if its for a good cause, said 10th-grader Adrian Penger. These people need the space to pray, and if that means the rest of us have to use the shed behind school, the girls volleyball locker room, Mitchell Johnsons van, or the ditch off Highway 65, then so be it. Sure, the space is a little cozy, but its more than big enough for a small house of worship, Adrian continued. We fit over 40 people there after prom last year! Wow! Simply amazing. If these high schoolers in Sedalia have proved anything, its that we shouldnt be so quick to judge teens. Theyre capable of incredible things, like sacrificing their fuck nest so that their neighbors can have a place to worship. And thats something people of all ages should applaud. ",2
1,"Introducing a new wrinkle into the already fraught fiscal cliff showdown, a consortium of billionaires today warned that if their taxes are raised they will no longer have enough money to buy politicians. The group, led by casino billionaire Sheldon Adelson, commissioned a new study showing that the cost of an average politician has soared exponentially over the past decade. While the American family has seen increases in the cost of food, health care and education, Mr. Adelson says, those costs dont compare with the cost of buying a politician, which has gone through the roof. The casino billionaire points to his groups study, which puts the cost of purchasing an average House member at two million dollars and an average senator at several times that. And lets say you buy a senator like Jim DeMint and he decides to quit, Mr. Adelson says. Good luck trying to get your money back. The Vegas magnate complains that the media has ignored billionaires essential role in giving jobs to politicians who would otherwise have difficulty finding honest work of any kind. Billionaires are providing employment for a group of seriously incompetent and marginal people, Mr. Adelson says. You raise taxes on us, and whos going to create those jobs? I really dont think people have thought this through. Adding insult to injury for Americas billionaires, he says, the simple dream of someday owning a President is slipping out of reach. People think a billion dollars buys you a President, but theyre wrong, he says. It barely gets you a lemon like Mitt Romney. ",3
1," On Tuesday, Senator Joni Ernst (R.-Iowa) responded to the recent measles outbreak with the following letter to the American people: Hi, its Joni! In recent days, youve heard about a measles outbreak among children who have not been vaccinated. Like many Americans, you have probably been asking, How would Joni solve this problem? Some in the media have suggested that politicians should not have opinions about vaccinations because were not scientists. Excuse me, but thats like saying people shouldnt have opinions about flowers because theyre not bees. The fact is, many parents are concerned about vaccinations, and for a valid reason: theyve read something bad about them on the Internet. But the good news is that theres an alternative to vaccinations thats cheap, readily available, and totally safe: bread bags. Take a look at a bread bag. Its made out of plastic, which means that no microscopic virus can get through it, unless theres a hole in the bag. Thats why, every morning, my parents sent me to school with bread bags on my hands. You see, measles are a hand-borne virus. You can only catch them through contact with someones measles-infected hand. If every child in America would go to school with bread bags on their hands, why, before you know it, measles would go the way of the Macarena (a dance that used to be very popular but has pretty much disappeared). Why hasnt anyone thought of this before? Maybe because theres big money behind vaccinations but not behind bread bags. No one makes money on bread bags. They just come with the bread. So do Joni a favor. Tomorrow, send your kids to school with bread bags on their hands. As my mom used to say, Joni, if theres a problem bread bags cant solve, its probably not a problem. To your health, Joni P.S. Important! This will only work if there are no holes in the bags. ",3
1,"In a possible setback for the Administrations controversial drone policy, a new poll conducted by the University of Minnesota shows that a broad majority of Americans are opposed to being killed by a drone strike on U.S. soil. The poll, which has a margin of error of plus or minus five percentage points, showed that ninety-seven per cent of those surveyed strongly agreed with the statement, I personally do not want to be killed by a drone, with three per cent responding, Dont know/No opinion. Theres no other way to interpret these numbers, said the University of Minnesotas Davis Logsdon, who oversaw the survey. The idea of being killed by a drone is not playing well out there. And while the poll numbers may not augur well for the Administrations expanding use of drones, the response was even more negative in a focus group of likely drone victims. One member of that group, a forty-three-year-old male from St. Paul, complained that it doesnt even seem like the government is trying to come up with alternatives to killing us with drones. It seems like they could figure out some kind of system where instead of just being killed by a drone, people could maybe present evidence to see if theyre guilty or not, he said. At the White House, spokesman Jay Carney tried to make the best of the poll results, telling reporters, Look, people are afraid of getting killed by a drone. We get that. But there is still broad public support for drones killing somebody else. ",3
1,"Amid the growing debate over building a wall on the U.S.-Mexico border, a new poll shows that voters who strongly favor building such a wall cannot successfully identify the border on a map. Additionally, the more enthusiastic voters are about building a wall, the less likely they are to know where the border is actually situated, the poll finds. Voters who could not correctly identify the U.S.-Mexico border provided no fewer than fifteen alternative locations for it. Nearly twenty per cent of respondents located it along the United States border with Canada. Being told that they had incorrectly identified the U.S.-Mexico border did not in any way dampen voters enthusiasm for building a wall there, however. To the contrary, voters believed that it would be easier to locate the border once it had a twenty-foot wall. Among voters who could not correctly identify the border, there was strong support for the Presidential candidacy of the billionaire Donald Trump. Ninety per cent of those voters strongly agreed that Trump knew where the border was, as opposed to only four per cent who said that about Wisconsin Governor Scott Walker.

1,"Days after Secret Service agents shortchanged a group of prostitutes in Colombia, the international trade group representing hookers downgraded the United States credit rating from AAA to B. The strong rebuke from the International Alliance of Professional Escorts came after a Secret Service agent reportedly paid one of its members thirty dollars for an eight-hundred-dollar service, or only four per cent of the stated price. The statement from the International Alliance of Professional Escorts said that in downgrading the United States credit rating it was sending a clear message that its members should be aware that doing business with the government of the United States carries with it a significant risk. We are urging our members to avoid conducting transactions with the United States and to focus on more reliable customers, like the International Monetary Fund, the statement added. Just hours after the announcement from the escorts group, the U.S. Congress passed the following resolution blasting the Secret Service for its actions: We strongly denounce the Secret Service for consorting with prostitutes, which has traditionally been Congresss role. But it was not all bad news this week for the Secret Service, which today reported a five-thousand-per-cent jump in enlistment. The agency said that enlistment offices across the country have been packed with prospective agents, including former House Speaker Newt Gingrich, who abruptly dropped out of the Presidential race to join.

1,"From using chemical weapons against Iraqi Kurds to actively seeking a nuclear bomb, ISIS shows no signs of stopping its reign of brutality, and the terror groups latest incursion proves it has no limits. Last week, members of the Islamic State fished up every last catfish out of the old creek past the Loomis property. Just sickening. Even as it threatens attacks against India and Pakistan, ISIS managed to carry out this act of swift and coordinated cruelty. Those whove gone out noodling since have reported nothing but fingerlings out there, when a summer or two back you couldnt hardly dip a toe in the current without a big sumbitch chomping on it. Driving home the operations staggering scale, initial reports suggest ISIS militants even managed to haul up Duke Hoff, that horse-stubborn seven-footer whos been lurking around Sutters Bend since Daddy still tugged his socks up. ISIS is truly capable of anything. What the terror group plans to do with all them catfish continues to spark speculation. So far, members have neither released one of their trademark videos nor circulated any flyers indicating a large-scale fry on the horizon. In this ongoing blackout, we can only hold our breaths. One thing, however, is certain: The days of carefree summertime angling are over. Without the catfish, nothings to keep old Mr. Loomis from damming up the creek in hopes of building a lake on his place for that plump wife of his, and thatll be that. While retaliation is sure to follow, the grievous losses inflicted by the Islamic State cannot be undone. At this point, decisive military action against ISIS cant come fast enough.

1,"In a meeting with Iraqi Prime Minister Nuri al-Maliki on Monday, Secretary of State John Kerry stressed the importance of forming a unity government in Iraq but refused to commit to a timetable for creating one in the United States. The sensitive topic of a unity government for the United States came at the end of a thirty-minute meeting, during which Secretary Kerry lectured the Iraqi Prime Minister about the value of a government where people of different parties put aside their differences, make meaningful compromises, and work together for the good of the nation. Taking this in, al-Maliki agreed that it was an excellent idea and politely asked Secretary Kerry if the United States had ever considered forming such a government. According to observers, Kerry appeared to be caught off guard by this question and blurted out,You first. Despite that awkward moment, after the meeting Kerry said that he had not totally slammed the door on the idea of a unity government in the United States. Lets just get one formed in Iraq, he said. If it works out for them, maybe someday well give it a try. ",4

Carson supporters, reeling from the news that their candidates past might have been devoid of stabbing, have deserted his candidacy in droves, suggesting that Republican voters viewed Carsons stabbing as a key part of his rsum. Indeed, a recent University of Minnesota poll showed that a full third of Carson supporters singled out his stabbing experience as a top reason for supporting him for the nations highest office. In Iowa, where Carson was the front-runner before the non-stabbing bombshell hit, voters like Carol Foyler, of Des Moines, expressed dismay and disillusionment that the retired doctor might have fabricated his stabbing exploits to make himself more appealing to Republican voters.

A recent statement issued by Reynolds Wrap has announced that because of the joke, Tosh is no longer permitted to use its products. Here is the companys statement: After three years of deliberation, we have instructed our vendors that they are no longer to sell Reynolds Wrap to Daniel Tosh. He is permanently banned from using Reynolds Wrap for any purpose. Ouch. Spokespeople for Reynolds went on to say that this ban extends to all Reynolds Kitchens products, including oven bags, baking pans, and freezer paper, as well as all varieties of aluminum foil, including heavy-duty and non-stick, so things are NOT looking good for the 40-year-old television host. Toshs lawyer has acknowledged that he received the statement. While he has yet to publicly respond, several other comedians have already come to his defense on Twitter: Reynolds has since clarified its stance to make it clear that the company is not condoning heckling: We at Reynolds believe that stand-up comedy is a performance and that comedians deserve as much respect as actors and other artists. Toshs reaction, however, was completely inappropriate. It is our firm belief that rape jokes are not funny. What do you think? Is Tosh getting his just desserts, or has Reynolds Wrap gone too far?

1,"A recent tour of the United States-Mexico border by Texas Governor Rick Perry has had the unintended consequence of convincing thousands of immigrants that anyone can succeed in America. After Gov. Perry and the Fox News host Sean Hannity toured the Rio Grande on Thursday, news quickly spread that the two men were actually among the most powerful in America, fueling the immigrants impression that the U.S. is a place where anyone can make it. When we learned that these two men were the governor of a large state and a top broadcaster from a major news network, it seemed too incredible to be true, said an immigrant from Honduras, speaking on the condition of anonymity. We all said to ourselves, if those two can succeed in America, imagine the wondrous things we might achieve. According to a border official, immigration at the border shot up eighty per cent since the appearance by the two men, and the situation could get even worse.

1,"The Berlin Wall was finally opened in 1989 and demolished by 1992, effectively lifting the Iron Curtain that had divided Europe for decades. This appeared to be a major blow to walls, and yet more than two decades later, walls are still with us. Why? 1. The Berlin Wall was only one wall: In the late 1980s, there were many walls in the world, and the Berlin Wall was not all of them. Instead, it was just one of them. The long-term consequences of this fact were far-reaching and various, but the most significant was that when the Berlin Wall was destroyed, only one wall was destroyed. 2. Not all walls are connected to each other: Though the Berlin Wall was very long, it was not so long that it joined up with all other walls in the world. If this had been so, theres a chance that demolishing the Berlin Wall would have ended walls forever, and today wed be living in a world without walls. But it was not to be. 3. Some walls are not even in Germany: The Berlin Wall was in Germany, with no part of the wall extending beyond the countrys borders. On the other hand, the same cannot be said of all walls. For example, the continued existence of walls like the Great Wall of China, which was and is in China, further proves that the fall of one wall in Germany never truly threatened walls in general. 4. People are always building walls: Beginning well before the Berlin Walls demolition, people have built walls to ensure separation between areas. The need for separate spaces, such as rooms, continued despite the destruction of the Berlin Wall, and even today, work on thousands of new walls across the world is underway. The continued construction of walls was a major factor that ensured that the fall of the Berlin Wall did not spell doom for all walls. 5. Reagan demanded that Gorbachev tear down this wall, not tear down all walls: Perhaps history would have played out differently had Ronald Reagan, in his famous 1987 speech at the Brandenburg Gate, called for Soviet leader Mikhail Gorbachev to tear down every single wall in the world, but this was not how it happened. The president limited his request to this wall, referring to the Berlin Wall. 6. There are many kinds of walls: The Berlin Wall was a specific type of wall known as a border wall, but there are other types of walls as well. The urgent political and social forces that precipitated the demolition of the Berlin Wall failed to exert the same influence on retaining walls, seawalls, or glass partition walls. Partly for this reason, countless such walls stand to this day. ",4
1,"Arguing that their recent trip to Cuba had made them Americas No. 1 national-security threat, a group of Republican lawmakers today called for tougher sanctions on the entertainers Beyonc and Jay-Z. We must send a strong message to Beyonc and Jay-Z that the United States of America will not tolerate this kind of provocation, said Rep. Mario Diaz-Balart (R-Florida), who blamed President Obama for permitting the crisis to escalate dangerously. While the President has allowed himself to be distracted by North Korea, Beyonc and Jay-Z were engaged in threatening activities right in our own hemisphere, he said, charging the President with being soft on Beyonc. Echoing his sentiments, Rep. Ileana Ros-Lehtinen called for the toughest economic sanctions possible to isolate the growing threat posed by Beyonc and Jay-Z. But while economic sanctions may be politically popular, White House spokesman Jay Carney cautioned that they would probably have little to no effect: Right now, Jay-Z and Beyonc have more money than the U.S. government does.

1,"On the eve of Facebooks I.P.O., founder and C.E.O. Mark Zuckerberg published the following letter to potential investors: Dear Potential Investor: For years, youve wasted your time on Facebook. Now heres your chance to waste your money on it, too. Tomorrow is Facebooks I.P.O., and I know what some of you are thinking. How will Facebook be any different from the dot-com bubble of the early 2000s? For one thing, those bad dot-com stocks were all speculation and hype, and werent based on real businesses. Facebook, on the other hand, is based on a solid foundation of angry birds and imaginary sheep. Second, Facebook is the most successful social network in the world, enabling millions to share information of no interest with people they barely know. Third, every time someone clicks on a Facebook ad, Facebook makes money. And while no one has ever done this on purpose, millions have done it by mistake while drunk. We totally stole this idea from iTunes. Finally, if you invest in Facebook, youll be far from alone. As a result of using Facebook for the past few years, over nine hundred million people in the world have suffered mild to moderate brain damage, impairing their ability to make reasoned judgments. These will be your fellow Facebook investors. With your help, if all goes as planned tomorrow, Facebooks I.P.O. will net a hundred billion dollars. To put that number in context, it would take JP Morgan four or five trades to lose that much money. One last thing: What will, I, Mark Zuckerberg, do with the eighteen billion dollars Im expected to earn from Facebooks I.P.O.? Well, Im considering buying Greece, but that would still leave me with eighteen billion dollars. LOL. Friend me, Mark ",3
1," A new poll released Thursday reveals that a broad majority of Americans describe themselves as deeply unhappy to have been reminded that the former Alaska Governor Sarah Palin exists. Palins call for the impeachment of President Obama, a ploy to remind people that she still roams the earth, appears to have backfired, the poll shows. With seventy-two per cent of respondents saying that they were upset or very upset to be reminded of her existence, Palin is one of three non-officeholders whose recent utterances have traumatized Americans. According to the poll, eighty-one per cent were upset to be reminded that Ann Coulter exists, while a hundred per cent felt that way about the existence of the former Vice-President Dick Cheney. ",2
1,"In a defiant statement, a spokesman for the fast-food industry today lashed out at fast-food workers outrageous and unacceptable demand to be considered human beings. Arguing that granting fast food workers anything beyond a grim, scraping existence would put a serious dent in our profits, the Fast Food Restaurant Council spokesman Tracy Klugian said. Considering our workers human would be ruinous to the fast food industry as we know it. But Mr. Klugian was quick to point out that the controversy was about more than money: Its about dignity and respecttwo things this industry has zero tolerance for. As fast food workers mounted protests across the country, the industry spokesman urged them to abandon their reckless quest for human status at once. They have to ask themselves, why did they want to work in the fast food industry to begin with? he said. Anyone who walks into one of our restaurants should realize that its no place for humans. ",3

Hannity commended the work of the Fox Ebola team, which provided non-stop coverage of the virus during the month of October, but added, This story is officially over. Foxs decision to bring its Ebola coverage to such an abrupt close raised eyebrows in media circles, but Hannity offered an explanation for the move after his broadcast concluded. Theres like, what, one case of Ebola in the United States? the host said. At most, two or three. The point is, the chances of any of our viewers catching Ebola are next to zero. Were not in the business of scaring people for no reason. Lets all move on. Hannity added that if there is an Ebola outbreak in the U.S., Fox would offer in-depth coverage of the crisis, probably in the fall of 2016. ",2
1," Telling Congress, Its O.K., I dont mind doing everything myself, President Obama prepared to sign a passive-aggressive executive order on Tuesday. While the President did not disclose details about the executive order, he told reporters, Im sure Congress is busy with a lot of other things and doesnt want to be bothered with stuff thats important to me. Really, they shouldnt give it a moments thought. Im happy to do the work of the entire government myself. After news of the Presidents passive-aggressive executive order reached Capitol Hill, House Speaker John Boehner prepared a narcissistic reply. Instead of signing more executive orders, President Obama needs to recognize that everything that happens in this government must begin and end with me, he said. At the White House, President Obama reacted to the Speakers narcissistic statement with a strongly worded passive-aggressive response. I hope that I havent troubled John Boehner in the slightest by sitting at my desk twenty hours a day doing the work of the entire country, he said, sighing heavily.

1,"Republican front-runner Donald Trump was crying foul on Monday after Vermont Senator Bernie Sanders allegedly dispatched an army of vegan thugs to attack a rally of peace-loving Nazis in Cincinnati. According to Trump, he had begun to address a group of orderly and civil Nazis at a downtown arena when his audience was suddenly set upon by an unruly mob of angry vegans, many menacingly clad in Birkenstocks and sustainable garments. The Sanders supporters, singing an alarmingly militant version of Simon & Garfunkels America, marched into the arena and began intimidating and threatening the Nazis, Trump said. Make no mistake about who is starting the violence at these rallies, Trump said. Its the vegans. Carol Foyler, a Nazi from suburban Cincinnati, said that she feared for her life when one of the vegans ripped a Trump sign from her hands and tried to recycle it. Harland Dorrinson, a Kentucky Nazi who drove to Ohio to hear Trump speak, said he would never have attended the rally if he had known there would be troublemaking vegans there. One of them tried to swing an NPR tote bag at my head, the terrified Nazi said. Watch:Meet the father of Times Square fixture the Naked Cowboy. ",2
1,"Prepare to be enraged. While most charities do work that is uplifting and positive, theres a new charity that is doing something truly awful. The charity is called Skys The Limit, and its mission is infuriating: providing convicted sex offenders with skydiving lessons absolutely free of charge. Just terrible. According to the organizations website, Skys The Limit has over 40 schools across the country and offers fully compensated classes for any person convicted of a sex-related misdemeanor or felony. The offenders are given a brief orientation covering the basics of skydiving before theyre taken to an altitude of 10,000 feet and paired with an instructor to do a tandem jump. After landing, theyre given a video of their dive that is shot from three camera angles and even a parachute decal for their carall at no cost. The charity is shockingly well-funded, has tax-exempt status as a nonprofit organization, and has already paid for hundreds of sex offenders to enjoy the excitement of skydiving for the first time. But it gets worse. Charity Navigator, a popular charity-rating site, gives Skys The Limit a four out of four star rating, citing its transparency and high percentage of donations going toward its programs. All of this is paid for by anonymous donors who could be giving their money to numerous other charities that actually do some good in the world. Yikes. If youre one of the many people out there who thinks sex offenders shouldnt even be getting a discount on their skydiving lessons, this news probably has you pretty upset. Unfortunately, as long as Skys The Limit isnt doing anything illegal, theres little that can be done to shut it down. We have to ask ourselves, what kind of society do we live in when children go hungry while sex offenders skydive for free? At this point, we can only hope that as awareness spreads, donations will dry up and sex offenders will end up having to pay to go skydiving like everyone else. ",3

The man, who was born in Calgary before drifting to Texas, has been spotted in Washington, D.C. in recent years exhibiting erratic behavior, sources said. In 2013, he gained entry to the United States Senate and was heard quoting incoherently from a childrens book before he was finally subdued. More recently, he was heard ranting about a plan to dismantle large components of the federal government, such as the Internal Revenue Service and the nations health-care program. Despite a record of such bizarre episodes and unhinged utterances, observers expressed little concern about his plans to get into the White House, calling them delusional. ",2

Right now, many of you are angry at the government, and no one is angrier than I am, he said. Quite frankly, I am glad that I have had no involvement in such an organization. The Presidents outrage only increased, he said, when he recently became aware of a part of that government called the Department of Justice. The more I learn about the activities of these individuals, the more certain I am that I would not want to be associated with them, he said. They sound like bad news. Mr. Obama closed his address by indicating that beginning next week he would enforce what he called a zero tolerance policy on governing. If I find that any members of my Administration have had any intimate knowledge of, or involvement in, the workings of the United States government, they will be dealt with accordingly, he said.

1,"With each passing day, ISIS reaches new heights of ruthlessness and brutality, and the terrorist groups most recent campaign might be its most devastating yet. According to the CIA, ISIS has invested over $25 million attempting to recruit Elvis Costello. This is absolutely horrifying. Over the past 18 months, the Islamic State has attempted to secure Costellos undying allegiance through a sustained targeted recruitment campaign. The organization has sent Costello thousands of propaganda materials, including high-production recruitment videos that address the Grammy-winning recording artist by name and offer him high-ranking military positions in the event that he elects to become a member of ISIS. They have also emailed Costello hundreds of personalized messages promising eternal rewards in heaven if the celebrated songwriter martyrs himself for the glory of Allah. It appears that ISIS will stop at nothing to recruit the rock-and-roll icon. Just take a look at this photograph that ISIS released earlier this week: Sparing no expense in the campaign to radicalize Elvis Costello, ISIS has even constructed a $6 million recording studio in Syria that officials named The Imperial Bedroom, a tribute to Costellos 1982 album of the same name. The studio is stocked with state-of-the-art recording equipment, and ISIS leader Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi appeared in a recent video to personally inform Costello that he would have exclusive access to the studio in exchange for his loyalty to the Islamic State. It looks like the situation is truly dire. Hopefully, ISIS can be stopped before it fully radicalizes Elvis Costello. Until then, the media barrage continues to intensify as ISIS tries everything in its power to turn the former Attractions bandleader to its violent extremist cause. ",2
1,"Dear American, For the past few weeks Ive been under constant attack. My opponents would have you believe that if Im elected, youll be stripped of your Social Security benefits and will be scrounging for food in dumpsters with all the desperation of a feral cat. Of course, thats true. But what they dont tell you is what Id replace Social Security with: an amazing new program I like to call Perrycare. Under Perrycare, youll receive all the food, clothing and shelter you need, and it wont cost a dime in taxes. How is that possible? Simple: youll be praying for all those things. As a Perrycare recipient, each week youll receive in your e-mail box a Perrycare PrayerMail, giving you an easy-to-recite prayer for the bread, milk, cat food, or whatever else you need to survive. Its like a Groupon from God. Perrycare is more than a replacement for that infernal Ponzi scheme that has bamboozled Americans with regular monthly checks for seventy-five years. It is part of my larger plan to return prayer to its rightful place in American life. I get down on my knees every night and I promise you, if I am elected your President, I will bring this entire country to its knees. I expect that some of my opponents will laugh at my plan, especially that lawn gnome Ron Paul and Michele (Crazy Eyes) Bachmann. Fine, let them laugh! Laughter is the best medicine. And if I am elected, there will be no other medicine. That brings me to my Perrycare medical plan, which will replace Medicare once I consign that Ponzi scheme to the electric chair of history. I dont have enough time to go into the whole plan right now, but here it is in two words: single prayer. Your next President, Governor Rick Perry ",2
1,"In a blockbuster documentary to be broadcast tonight, the Fox News Channel alleges that Obamacare is little more than a thinly veiled scheme to force Americans to live longer. The documentary, called The Ugly Truth About Obamacare, claims that President Obama is cynically using the health-care law to achieve his true objective: raising the life expectancy of Americans without their consent. In America, how long you live has always been your own business, says the documentarys narrator, Sean Hannity. Under Obamacare, though, its the governments businessa government that wants you to live as long as humanly possible. The documentary lays out a nightmare scenario of Americans being saddled with sky-high life expectancies for years to come. In perhaps the most chilling prediction of the documentary, Mr. Hannity warns, If Obamacare goes into effect, Americans will be forced to live as long as people in Finland, Denmark, and other socialist countries. Speaking with reporters today, Mr. Hannity said he hoped that the documentary would be a wake-up call about the secret agenda behind Obamacare. President Obama is playing God with American lives, Mr. Hannity said. And if he stubbornly insists on making those lives longer, that could be grounds for impeachment. ",2

When it comes to dealing with foreign countries, President Obama doesnt have a clue, said Mitt Romney, who during a summer visit to London caused the biggest international incident between the United States and Great Britain since the War of 1812. Only I have what it takes to bring peace to the Middle East. Mr. Romneys statement about his foreign-policy prowess drew an official response from British Prime Minister David Cameron, who in a tersely worded statement, said, Hah, good one. But the G.O.P. nominee pressed on with this theme during several campaign stops today, saying that his trial by fire at the London Olympics had prepared him for foreign-policy challenges ahead. Dealing with something as straightforward as the Middle East will be like a day at the beach compared to a volatile tinderbox like England, he said. Mr. Romney also laid out his plans for bringing a lasting peace to the Middle East: Right now, the region is chaos. Entire countries are in uproar, and they are focussing their anger on America. The only way for us to fix that is by attacking Iran. In other political news, the Dow Jones Industrial Average hit a four-year high, making President Obama the crappiest socialist in history. ",4

A picture of ISIS Lamb Chopwhich is based on the late ventriloquist Shari Lewis beloved puppet but features a disturbingly lifelike and fleshy human assbegan circulating online this morning in what can only be described as a horrific and senseless attack on all of humanity. The militant Islamist group quickly took credit for the puppet in a statement posted on social media. Many details regarding ISIS Lamb Chop puppet are still unknown, but the altered Lamb Chop appears to be an exact replica of the one used by Shari Lewis on her 1990s PBS show, Lamb Chops Play-Along, with the lone exception of its shockingly realistic human ass. It has yet to be determined how members of the Islamic State were able to achieve such verisimilitude with their addition to the Lamb Chop puppet, but officials have confirmed that it is an extremely realistic-looking ass. News of the Lamb Chop puppets impeccably rendered human ass sent shockwaves throughout the world, with millions taking to social media to express grief and outrage regarding ISIS giving the cherished puppet such a realistic ass that looks like it belongs to a human and not a lamb. Others urged users not to share the picture of ISIS Lamb Chop puppet due to its disturbing and graphic nature. Today was another chilling reminder that ISIS willingness to inflict pain and suffering on innocent people around the world knows no bounds. Lets just hope our security forces are better able to prevent them from carrying out attacks like this in the future. ",2

Moreover, he said, Trump has not put in the many years of solitary seething that most random shooters deem mandatory. Before you do a random shooting, youre supposed to be quiet and keep to yourself, he said. Trump is always shouting at thousands of people. Dorrinson added that although many random shooters have been in the Trump camp thus far, the candidates vague random-shooting plan is now giving them pause. Donald Trump made it sound like a random shooting is just the easiest thing in the world, he said. At the end of the day, random shooters find that hurtful.

By a 54 majority, the Court struck down an Ohio law that would make it harder to lie in political ads, arguing instead that any attempt to restrict or punish lying by politicians is an unconstitutional infringement on a religion they have practiced for decades. The Courts decision won praise from politicians of both parties, with many saying that the Justices recognition of lying as a religion was long overdue. Writing for the majority, Chief Justice John Roberts argued, For politicians, lying is a religious observance akin to attending a church or a synagogue, except that they do it seven days a week. ",2

I honestly dont see what the fuss is all about, Mr. Kim said in an official statement today. Of course its the governments right to know what people are doing at all timesand journalists would be right at the top of the list. Mr. Kim also offered a vigorous defense of the I.R.S. policy of auditing the tax returns of organizations that oppose the government: Again, this is something I wouldnt lose a wink of sleep over, and I know Dad felt the same way. In what was an otherwise laudatory statement about the activities of the U.S. government, Mr. Kim offered one small critique: They could save themselves the work of conducting audits and obtaining phone records if they would just get rid of journalists and anti-government groups in the first place. But, you know, baby steps. All in all, news of the I.R.S. audits and phone-records scandals have given the mercurial dictator hope that North Korea and the United States might have warmer relations in the future: We have a lot more in common than I thought.

I want to make it clear that when it comes to those things, I take a back seat to no one.

In the hopes of proving that Trump has no monopoly on odiousness, aides have released a point-by-point comparison showing that on such key issues as workers rights and health care, Walker is just as terrifying as the former reality-show host. Acknowledging that Trump has dominated media attention for now, Walkers aides believe that the governor will eventually reclaim his rightful mantle as the worst person in the race. Sooner or later, the Trump candidacy is going to fall apart and voters are going to be looking for another dick to vote for, one aide said. Scott Walker wants to be that dick. ",2

1,"In what some experts are calling a strong indicator of improvement in the economy, Republicans in recent weeks have begun renewing their claims that President Barack Obama was not born in the United States. While most economists agree that any significant improvement in the U.S. economy is generally accompanied by an uptick in G.O.P. questions about Mr. Obamas place of birth, there is now an econometric tool for measuring the increase in those claims: the so-called S. & P. Birther Index. The Birther Index, established in 2008, measures the occurrences of such words as birth certificate, Kenya, and wasnt born here in Republican statements about the President, and has proven to be a surprisingly reliable tool for tracking improvements in the economy. Harland Dorinson, the economist who devised the S. & P. Birther Index, said that as the economy recovers the index also shows a strong surge in statements questioning the Presidents Christianity. As unemployment started going down, we saw an increase in references to Mr. Obama being a Muslim, he said. This is generally a very bullish sign for the economy.

1,"Following his controversial remarks over the weekend, U.S. Senate candidate Rep. Todd Akin (R-Missouri) today issued the following apology to Missouri voters: Dear Voter: Over the weekend, I made remarks suggesting that rape could be legitimate and that a uterus could think. Today, I would like to offer every woman in Missouri my deepest apology. If your uterus could talk, Ill bet it would have some choice words about old Todd right about now. For the last forty-eight hours, Ive been getting an earful from a lot of you. Youve said that Im an ignorant, dangerous man. Youve said that I should be put away someplace where I can do as little harm as possible. To that I say, I couldnt agree more. And that place is the U.S. Senate. I know what some of you are thinking: if we send Todd to the Senate, wont he be able to do more damage than he did in the House? Well, think again. In the House, I was a member of the Science Committee. Scientific matters that impact the entire nation were entrusted to a man who thinks that lady parts have E.S.P. Electing me to the Senate will get me as far away from science as possible. But heres the most important reason to keep me in Washington. As long as I am in Congress, I will be on C-SPAN, where you can monitor me around the clock. If I look like I am about to go off, you can notify the authorities and have me quickly subdued. Its democracys version of the electronic ankle bracelet. On the other hand, if I lose, Ill come back to Missouri and be released into the general population. The choice is yours, Missouri. I hope youll act like a uterus and do the smart thing. Vote for me, Todd ",2
1,"Fox News announced on Wednesday that it is terminating its coverage of the Ebola virus effective immediately, because, in the words of the host Sean Hannity, Our work is done. Hannity commended the work of the Fox Ebola team, which provided non-stop coverage of the virus during the month of October, but added, This story is officially over. Foxs decision to bring its Ebola coverage to such an abrupt close raised eyebrows in media circles, but Hannity offered an explanation for the move after his broadcast concluded. Theres like, what, one case of Ebola in the United States? the host said. At most, two or three. The point is, the chances of any of our viewers catching Ebola are next to zero. Were not in the business of scaring people for no reason. Lets all move on. Hannity added that if there is an Ebola outbreak in the U.S., Fox would offer in-depth coverage of the crisis, probably in the fall of 2016. ",2
1,"Delivering a stirring populist message at a campaign appearance in New Hampshire, Hillary Clinton vowed that as President she would help everyday Americans obtain large cash payments from foreign governments. Like a lot of everyday Americans, many of you are struggling to pay your bills, she told an audience here. As President, I will work tirelessly to help you make ends meetby getting foreign governments to pay you. In cold, hard cash, she added, to a standing ovation. Growing emotional, the former Secretary of State spoke of the transformative power of foreign money, calling it nothing short of magical. Ive seen up close how large sums of foreign currency can change peoples lives, she said. And I will not rest until every middle-class American partakes of the riches of the Emirates. Clinton said that she and she alone was qualified to disgorge heaps of cash from foreign governments, and took a swipe at two of her Republican rivals. Do you honestly think Ted Cruz could pry loose any Moroccan moneyor Rand Paul? she asked. Come on. No one in Morocco knows those losers. ",2
1,"In an effort to boost his foreign-policy credentials, the billionaire Donald Trump on Tuesday said that, if he were elected President, he would defeat ISIS with brutal and relentless attacks on Twitter. Under President Obama, ISIS has been able to maraud and rampage with impunity, Trump told Fox News. When Im in the White House, the leaders of ISIS are going to bear the brunt of the most vicious tweets the world has ever known. The real-estate mogul said that, as President, he would set aside a portion of the time that he currently allots to excoriating journalists, politicians, and assorted other perceived enemies on Twitter to focus his fury on the leaders of ISIS. Of all the people running for President, I have by far the most Twitter-war experience, he boasted. I will declare an all-out Twitter war on ISIS, and I will win. Offering a taste of his proposed Twitter campaign, Trump produced this sample tweet: ISIS is a total joke. Has zero chance of winning. Zero! Another prospective tweet read, ISIS leaders live in tents. Trump has TEN BILLION DOLLARS. Kicks their ass! In yet another example, he offered, Never see ISIS leaders with models. Why? Cannot get models. Models love Trump! The former reality-show star also blasted President Obama for having a Twitter account with more than three million followers and never once using it to call Russian President Vladimir Putin a loser.

The sixty-second spot stars an assortment of kittenstabbies, calicoes, Siamese, and a dozen other breedsin a variety of adorable vignettes. At various points in the advertisement, the kittens are shown playing in a sock drawer, tangled up in yarn, and chasing a duckling. Clinton herself appears only in the final seconds of the ad, saying merely, Hi. Im Hillary. The commercial immediately drew the wrath of the Republican National Committee chairman, Reince Priebus, who called it woefully short on substance. Theres no mention of what Hillary Clinton would do to grow our struggling economy, fix the disaster of Obamacare, or repair our damaged reputation abroad, a visibly furious Priebus told Fox News. Its just cats. In defense of the ad, the Clinton campaign issued the following statement: America loves kittens. Loving kittens makes America strong. Hillary is ready for kittens.

1,"Canada, already bracing for the possible inflow of millions of American refugees in November, might have made matters worse by releasing an unacceptably adorable photo of its Prime Minister hugging two baby pandas, Canadians fear. The photo, taken at the Toronto Zoo and showing Justin Trudeau cuddling with two panda cubs, was the last thing this country needed, Harland Dorrinson, the executive director of Canadians for Responsible Immigration, a prominent anti-immigration organization based in Ottawa, said. Canada is already staring down the potential crisis of millions of Americans pouring over its border later this year, Dorrinson said. Did we really have to announce that we have pandas, too? The news photo, which Dorrinson called an unmitigated disaster, is expected to worsen the influx of illegal Americans because, he said, in addition to pointing out that Canada has pandas, it is also reminding people that our Prime Minister is an unusually handsome man, especially for someone in government. In an open letter published online, the anti-immigration leader urged Trudeau to put his country first and cancel a visit scheduled for Friday at the Winnipeg Puppy and Kitten Shelter.

Thats what theyre saying at the global terror group, whose Human Resources department has recently turned to the social-networking site LinkedIn in hopes of filling the slot.

1,"A day after President Obama held a nationally televised town hall about guns in America, a new poll shows that a majority of Republicans would rather actually be shot by a firearm than agree with him. In an indication of the challenges facing the President in persuading Republicans, those surveyed named a wide variety of specific guns that they would choose to be personally shot by rather than seeing eye to eye with Obama. When asked to state their preference, forty-three per cent stated handgun, twenty-seven per cent replied shotgun, twenty-one per cent responded assault rifle, while only two per cent named agreeing with Obama. The poll results are reminiscent of a poll taken last month about climate change, in which a majority of Republicans said they would rather see their habitat destroyed by rising sea levels than agree with President Obama.

Within an hour of the videos appearance, Trump took to Twitter to crow about his role in the jihadist promo, and tweaked his G.O.P. rivals for failing to be chosen by Shabaab. Shabaab would never put Jeb in video, Trump tweeted. Knows he is loser! But even as the billionaire boasted about his inclusion in the terror video, the prospect for future collaborations between Trump and Shabaab seemed to dim, due to a series of escalating demands issued by the real-estate magnate. In a cascade of tweets directed at the terror group, Trump insisted that he be paid two million dollars for every subsequent video and that he retain editorial control over the final cut. In a terse official statement, a Shabaab spokesman said that the terror group was discontinuing our relationship with Donald J. Trump. Hes just too hard to work with, the spokesman said.

1,"Experts are calling for a national conversation about post-gala violence, which many say is a growing epidemic among Americas wealthiest gala attendees. Dr. Davis Logsdon, who, for the past decade, has been studying post-gala violence at the University of Minnesota, says that a national conversation about post-gala skirmishes is long overdue. For years, post-gala violence has been Americas dirty little secret, he says. The media havent covered it, and government has offered no solutions. Thats why this moment is such a valuable wake-up call. Dr. Logsdon says that the key to preventing post-gala violence is first understanding its root causes. Galas are very stressful situations, he says. Attendees have spent thousands on gowns and spa treatments, and tens of thousands more on silent-auction items. All of that pressure has to go somewhere. More often than not, it erupts into violence. He credits the national media, especially TMZ, for finally shining a light on one of the nations biggest problems. As regrettable as this incident was, if it results in people talking seriously about post-gala violence, it will all have been worth it, he says. ",3
2,"Ferguson Protesters Take Advantage Of Cop-Involved Shooting In South St. Louis With Unrest Here we go again. We in St. Louis are getting really tired of this. Last evening at about 7:30 in the Shaw Neighborhood of the City of St. Louis, so named for being the area around the Missouri Botanical Garden or Shaws Garden, an off-duty St. Louis City cop who was working a second shift or security for a private firm with permission, shot and killed a suspect who physically threatened him according to reports. A simple narrative of the incident is posted on the KMOV website, the local CBS television affiliate: Authorities said the shooting occurred in the 4100 block of Shaw around 7:30 p.m. According to police, an off-duty police officer was patrolling for a private security company in the Shaw neighborhood. As he drove by the intersection of Klemm and Shaw, he noticed three men. Police said the men started to run and the officer chased after them. Authorities said the officer eventually got out of his car and followed a suspect through a gangway. St. Louis Police Chief Sam Dotson said the three suspects then came back together before one of them approached the officer in an aggressive way. According to police, the officer commanded the suspect to stop, but police said he refused to stop. Police said the officer and suspect got into a physical altercation before the suspect ran. Police said the suspect then fired three shots at the officer before the officer returned fire. According to police, the suspect attempted to fire more shots, but the gun malfunctioned and jammed. In total, police said the officer fired 17 shots. Authorities later recovered the suspects 9 millimeter gun. The suspect is deceased and described as an 18-year-old African American male. As if answering a bell, the Ferguson protesters swarmed the neighborhood. Overnight there was unrest, the politically correct term for riots and mass destruction just because it can be done. In this case, every news outlet is reporting that many of the protesters who showed up, are the very same ones who protested not just in Ferguson, but at Busch Stadium during Cardinals playoff games, and downtown. In the Shaw Neighborhood last night, a beautifully restored section of the city with Victorian era architecture just south of what used to be no mans land and is now new housing where a lot of city cops live, the professional thugs broke windows and attacked police cars while the scene was being worked. In addition, this edition of protests spilled out onto Grand Avenue, which is close to Saint Louis University Hospital and Cardinal Glennon Childrens Hospital. Police closed much of Grand Avenue near I-44 late Wednesday night because they said protesters were walking into the street. As of 2 a.m. Wednesday, portions of Grand Avenue were still closed. According to anStLToday.com article, relatives of the suspect claim he was not armed, which is disputed by the account above and the statement from Police Chief Dotson quoted in the article itself. According to Gateway Pundit, there are already rumors being spread that the suspect was tased and then shot 16 times. The total number of rounds was actually 17, and this is the only place where tasing is mentioned. Gateway Pundit also warns that Ferguson is one thing, the city is something else. (This is true.) Other details from the StLToday piece: And the mob is calling this Michael Brown all over again repeating facts that are not facts and rumors via social media whipping up a frenzy. Under normal circumstances, the Shaw Neighborhood is very quiet and is frequented by many St. Louisans. As of today, word from the police wives is that they are back to twelve hour shifts as happens when there is unrest. Tensions are growing as the Ferguson protesters show up to any venue where they can disrupt the usual way of things and get attention for doing so. The region is becoming very divided along supporters of police and not, mostly second amendment supporters vs. liberal whackadoodles. And no one outside of St. Louis seems to get that Michael Brown/Darren Wilson is not settled yet because the grand jury isnt done and by Missouri state law, information cannot be released from the police or the court until they are finished. This shooting comes as plans are in the works to evacuate Ferguson in case of no indictment of Darren Wilson, the officer who shot and killed Michael Brown in Ferguson in north St. Louis County. National race riot agitators are now warning of massive unrest if the grand jury finds that there is not enough evidence to charge Wilson with a crime. Any crime. Tonight is the Blues home opener. With all luck, the weather may hold some of the unrest at bay as rain and thunderstorms are predicted.

2,"Vote Rigging Is Real And Practically Undetectable Donald Trump has a knack for shining a spotlight on important issues. In this case the issue is one that affects all of us, the ability to fairly and with integrity elect the next president of the United States on a one vote per citizen voter basis. There is an electronic voting system called the GEMS election management system, which is utilized by approximately 25 percent of the country. The unfortunate reality is that it has at its core, designed into it, the ability to commit election fraud through vote manipulation. One of the key methods the fraud is committed is through a fractional vote feature. Fractional vote tabulating is embedded in each GEMS application. Votes can be altered through the pre-setting of vote percentages to redistribute votes to predetermined levels, completely disregarding the actual votes cast. The process is invisible and impossible to detect to the poll watchers and others lacking the computer expertise and a trip under the hood of the machine. According to the site Black Box Voting, Use of the decimalized vote feature is unlikely to be detected by auditing or canvass procedures, and can be applied across large jurisdictions in less than 60 seconds. They cite some familiar names in their list of GEMS fraud-enabled machines, including Global Election Systems, Diebold Election Systems, Premier Election Systems, Dominion Voting Systems, and Election Systems Software. There are also a number of private regional subcontractors. The compromised machines in question were, at the time of the writing of their document, used in the states of Alaska, Connecticut, Georgia, Mississippi, New Hampshire, Utah and Vermont, as well as counties in Arizona, California, Colorado, Florida, Illinois, Indiana, Iowa, Kansas, Kentucky, Massachusetts, Michigan, Missouri, Ohio, Pennsylvania, Tennessee, Texas, Virginia, Washington, Wisconsin and Wyoming. The GEMS system is also used in Canada. Overall percentages can also be manipulated, such as assigning one candidate with 45% of the votes, another with 35% and the other 10% to another. Those will be the final results regardless of the actual votes cast. Fractions are not visible in the final reports by default, with decimals reported as whole numbers. All evidence of tampering or that fractional values ever existed can be instantly cleared from the underlying database using a setting in the GEMS data tables. They note that the instructions to treat votes as decimal values instead of whole numbers appear multiple times within the GEMS source code ruling out any possibility of accidental creation of the effect. Ms. Harris points out that Fractionalizing the Statement of Votes Cast allows an extraordinary amount of precision, enabling alteration of results by specific voting machine, absentee batch, or precinct. Vote results can be altered for polling places in predominantly Black neighborhoods, and can parse out precincts within a mixed batch of early or absentee votes. Fractionalizing the under vote category allows reallocation of valid votes into under votes. Theres even a race-based weighting feature, which may explain how Mitt Romney got no votes in large swaths of black districts or how Hussein Obama was able to garner 100% over equally large parts of the United States. They report that, According to programmer notes, a weighted race feature was designed which not only gives some votes more weight than others, but does so based on the voters identity. Ballots are connected to voters; weights are assigned to each voter per race, stored in an external table not visible in GEMS. Our testing shows that one vote can be counted 25 times, another only one one-thousandth of a time, effectively converting some votes to zero. They have extensive research and information on their site at linked here. Once again, Donald Trump is right. ",3
2,"Freed Slaves In Washington? Dont Blame Us We Werent Born Yet! April of 2015 was the 150th anniversary marking the conclusion of the civil war. We have a few in Washington who want you to think they are that old. They want to punish white people for something that took place 150 years ago. Sheila Jackson said she is a freed slave. The only chain she has ever known is the gold wrapped around her neck paid for by the American taxpayer. She hasnt missed a meal in over forty years and eats well in first class. For her to say she is a freed slave is equally ignorant as the men who once owned slaves. There isnt anyone that holds a right to punish for what happened 150 years ago. They too have no right to take credit for what Dr. King did fifty years ago. Some of our leaders are turning the Kings dream into a nightmare. Dr. King stood for civil rights while attempting to unite Americans. People like Al Sharpton do nothing to better the lives of anyone while driving a wedge between black and white. The last I checked, there are hungry white people, simply as there are black. How many lives are better in this country because of Al Sharpton and his racist rants. He exists on the back of a man who struggles while making his way to the top. Hunger and poverty knows no color and the same holds true for racial discrimination. Racist arent born, they are taught. Its taught in front of the TV, listening to the ignorance flowing from these peoples mouths. Its taught in churches by men like Al Sharpton, who insult the name of Reverend. We should put Al Sharpton and the Westboro Baptist church together and have them duke it out. They are hypocrites and racist that need to go away. Millions of Americans struggle everyday while some millionaires in Washington say they can relate. They exist in the top one percent of wealth in this country and have a lot more than most. If we want to clean this country up we have to start by getting rid of the trash. Trash comes in every color and every bit of it stinks Semper Fi America, and may God bless you all, Shep simple solution herestick a Brace Bit in this coons mouth, jam a Ball Socket up its tail, then hitch the damn thing to a plow on my grand-pas new Slave Plantation near Baltimore It was legal back then, so the government still owes the slave owners money for lost property! And now, people are saying that Hillary should be elected because it is about time we had a female President. Monstrous stupidity! the stupidity of the people in this country is mind blowing Get this! I saw an article somewhere that said that she has a degree from YALE! Incredible! hell where do you think the black slaves came from ? in Africa when the tribes fought and took captives they sold the captives as slaves. And the Muslims were really into selling slaves to America. these are very good arguments , but you might try to explain that to the idiots in a Texas town that voted to give reparations to blacks for their relatives being slaves . Idiot Liberals . please tell me one white person that thinks the United States is over 400 years old? And she went to college ? THESE are called Liberal zombies !!! thats like saying to vote for Hillary , because she is a woman . But we all know she is a corrupt moron. She has open distain for the American public. She holds herself above the laws , she lies to the voters . She got a very good friend killed , Chris Stevens in Benghazie , and after wards lied about it and threw him under the bus as she claims he was there voluntarily , when in fact , she ordered him there and he could not defend himself , he was dead . She claims her and Bill were broke when they left the White house. Now they have two mansions, you know he gets a very good pension . and she gets $250000 per speaking engagement and he gets over $300000 per speaking engagement . She is broke by her standards , which means she is out of touch with the average American. The Clinton Foundation accepted donations from Arab countries that torture women and treat them badly yet she claims to be for womans rights . So I guess it is ok to look the other way when it comes to money and donations. And she has delibertly deleted and used and unauthorized server , while serving as Secretary of State . When she deleted the e-mails she is saying I am above the law and screw Americas right to information that would prove who was responsible in Benghazie. So this is a long answer but just because she is a woman .DO YOU WANT SOMETHING LIKE THIS RUNNING YOUR COUNTRY ? Shelia Jackson Lee is a STUPID black bitch. When I say stupid because she not only resembles a gorilla , but has an IQ lower than a gorilla . She actually thinks America is over 400 years old and she says the American people do not have the right to know what goes on in Congress. I can only assume if she has a college degree ,she got it on one of the online quickie websites. And this says a lot about the stupid black morons that voted her in office. I have been telling people this for years now.. But when you tell a black person they argue that I am trying to change history to make myself feel good.. Because of course they will never give up that whoa is me mentality because then they may have to work for what they get.. This is true they were many, many more Irish slaves than they ever were black slaves.. Oh they still think he is the greatest even after all the damage he has done to America.. I had Democrat tell me yesterday that (want to be ) King O was the best president in American history.. I can not believe that some Americans can be so utterly stupid I told a black man the other day it wouldnt have mattered if Democrats had of put Buckweat in the running he would have won!!! Because the blacks were going to vote for anyone black and some whites would have voted for anyone black for fear of being called a raciest And that when Obama was elected we got someone with about the same amount of experience as Buckweat I just ignore the ignorant. Regardless of color, if youre a special kind of stupid then you just cease to exist. You cannot be an idiot and be taken seriously. We need solutions in a world gone crazy. Jackson is an angry racist and bigot who never had to wait. She is a slave to her hate. She can go to hell and not come back. howso? His approval rating above democrats is still high. On places where they disagree with him, its because hes not liberal ENOUGH They also forget the many white people who gave their lives to end slavery. Those far outnumbered the few slave owners. Well put. The response is what Netanyahu said- No deal is better than a bad deal. Well, no black president is better than a bad black president. Maybe those friends will have a chance to vote for a good black president in 2016. Maybe West or Carson or Cain who knows? Any one of them would be 100X better than Obama. This woman is as stupid as the representative from one of the southern states (democrap) that thought Guam would CAPSIZE (!!!!) if too many military troops got on one side of the island! You cant fix stupid! The question is, what kind of dummies elect these idiots???? I know where she can stick that finger! The Only Change Obamas made is from the 20 bucks you paid for lunch, you have .19 cents left over, The Change Think we can all agree electing based on Color has proven to be a disaster. Black got Obama hired and Black keep him from being Impeached! Yes Keith I would say that Mark is a democrat, almost bet he wont admit it. Washington D.C. has the highest number of Idiots per square mile than anywhere in the world, except maybe California. Iam totally ashamed of the people representing us in Washington and around the world. Can you imagine what the foreign countries think when Obama comes to their Country and makes an ass out of himself. ill informed Yes, they voted for Obama because they thought he was best for the job, and because they were Ill informed. Well, they now rue the day.. Yes, I had good friends too (very nice people) who voted for McCain because Sarah Palin is hot. Both stupid reasons, but I also have friends who voted for Obama because they thought he was the best for the job. I get it, Bill. Youre sick of black people and theyre stupid. THATS why they vote Democrat. Its NOT because the Republican party is filled with racists who think theyre stupid. Its because blacks are in fact stupid. I want reparation for the relatives who died in the civil war freeing the slaves and yes I can prove it I would LOVE to have 30 minutes to talk to this moron!!! I would show her HISTORY, which she clearly skipped in school!! There were white slaves too!! I am so tired of this one sided crap!! Poor pitiful me!!! The difference is that the whites left it alone, years ago!!! If she continues, I will cause such a ruckus and demand someone, ANYONE, pay for my people being slaves!!! Whites were tortured and starved and held as slaves at the same time she is speaking of and before!! She doesnt look this old!! Over 200 years old?? Wow!!!!!!! O is not our first black prez!!! he is arabic, and white!! I think, 67% white!! But, who really knows!! He came from Kenya, not an american citizen so either way you look at it, he is NOT a prez! How can one say he is our first black prez?? If we had, had a black prez, all this going against our constitution and bringing all kinds of filth into our country, would not have happened!! O is moslem, plain and simple and NOT BLACK!! To call him black, is an insult to the African Americans!!! I have to ask , why is it we Americans are condemned for actions of 100 years ago? TODAY slavery is alive and well in Islamic Countries around the world? Is it just me or did I miss something????? Blacks refereed to as pigs in he Koran. Whats up with this??? If she wants to preach slavery, then she should better educate herself. First of all, slavery did not begin and end 200 plus years ago with black people. There is not a single race on this planet that hasnt been enslaved by another at one point in history or another, including many many white cultures. Not one. Pick up a history book sometime and read about ancient history. Slavery was extremely common back then. Second, slavery today is a much bigger problem than it ever was during the black slave days in early America. The sex slave trade is a huge HUGE problem today and it affects every country, every race, every skin color, every sex, adults and children. If she really wants to do something about slavery, she should start working on todays issues and stop living in the past. Just ask them how that CHANGE is working out for them? Look u cow, my grandparents on both sides of the family came here in the late 1800s to early 1900s and had nothing to do with bringing slaves to this country and wish they were never brought over. They should have left the spear chuckers in Africa and we would be saving a bundle on welfare now and getting it to the people who need it not to the ones who abuse it. Look u cow, my grand parents came here from both my fathers mothers side from Scotland and England. they had nothing to do with bringing the slaves in to this country and wished to God they never did. Should have left all you spear chuckers in Africa. Would have saved a bundles on Welfare. just another nigger on a piwer trip We dont want them back, we got them from everywhere and has ruined some areas in Baton Rouge in the Worst ways. Katrina Nope the monkeys would protest, discrimination cause they dont like competition either. You shake you head and use steve urkle voice look what you did. Lol Who would want to own this ugly ignorant asshole? Bill Morrow, I have some good friends, (very nice people who voted for Obama because it was about time we had a black president.how does one respond to such nonsense? I learned in college. God forbid they teach the truth in high schools! Just like Sharpton, Jackson, and farakhan do. Stir up black people and make problems between the races! The only thing this bigoted witch is a victim of is inbreeding Sheila Jackson Lee was a racist whack job back during the Clarence Thomas confirmation hearings. That, my friend, was long before Katrina! All because of Katrina. Houston wasnt always like that. Send the transplants back to Louisiana Me 2 Google it. I dont know about all his claims but a few are true. You can also look up irish slaves. While true that indentured servants were supposed to be freed eventually, few ever were. Most died before fulfilling their contract. Also check white slaves on sugar plantations, for further reading on white slavery. The Blacks have had access to the same education as most of us but have failed to utilize the opportunity ! Get your check from the millions of blacks that are multi millionaires ! The shame of the whole thing isnt Sheila Jackson Lee, or even the bile she spews it is the pathetic constituency that continues to reelect her. Think about this it is quite obvious that she is a laughingstock and an embarrassment to the people of Georgia, but these color blinded idiots continue to pull the lever for this stupid race baiter. Isnt it amazing. we have a holiday to celebrate the life of Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr. who taught that we should judge a man not by the color of his skin but but by the content of his character, and yet the blacks that venerate him elect people by the color of their skin over the things they represent! The Irish were pretty much slaves when they came to America! When immigrants used to come to this country, they worked their butts off to not only to make a better life, but to become of the greatest country on Earth, they learned the language, got jobs or built business never ever dreamed of living of the hard work of others and they made this country stronger and better! God Bless You! Love your comment. My great Grandfather came here in 1929, almost penniless. According to family stories, the proudest day of his life was when he EARNED his citizenship. He hung an American flag out in front of a house he had built that day, and that flag was flown by whatever member of the family that lived there until 2004 when the property was sold and the house torn down. When involved in a discussion that is debating the intelligence and moral make up of group of people that are of a different race than your own. It would be advisable to not promote yourself as an ignorant, uneducated, foul-mouthed, race hater. FYI..this country was not initially inhabited by WHITE men, and in addition.dont recall anything in the Declaration of Independence or the US Constitution that says that this country was founded for white men. I am a very conservative white American woman, but I agree with Ninitothree Rennie, you are contributing to the ongoing hate that seems to be running rampant in this country. I can only pray that before it is too late for us all, the constant hateful mud slinging will end and Americans will see that they must join together to survive. Google the first slave owner in America Yes it is true slaves were used in this country. they were used to do many things. And some unpleasant. We are not slaves anymore. We now have more chances to excel in this country As you have Shelia. So please stop your winning about slavery. Mark, youre a democrat arent you? Well said! I believe that Sharpton, Jackson Jr., and Holder should be brought up on charges for inciting riots! The very protests going on to this day are a direct result of their words and actions in relation to the Ferguson shooting. The are no credit to their race or country! I stand here a freed Irish slave!! How about we just remove her from office? I mean, instead of all the sarcasm which does not a bit of good, why dont we actually do something with a little bit of common sense to it? If you look at the history of slavery you will find many cases of one African tribe attacking another tribe, enslaving the tribe then selling them to the Portuguese pirates who in turn would sell them in the U.S. Its not a race thing, its a power thing! They dont.the machine elects them. I know in my state, for midterms the machines were changing votes from Rep to Dem.. Shelia is an IDIOT, she has no idea what shes talking about. She totes racism to get other blacks fired up and jumping on her band wagon. Cant tell who is more stupid, her or the racists commenting about her. :/ The first slaves were Jews that the Egyptians held. When we lived in Houston, Sheila Jackson Lee made herself look like an idiot then and now. Go get some education, Sheila. Idiots like her CREATE racists. Wow, Mark Kling, you are part of the reason why there is continuing racism and hatred in this country. As a white woman, even I am offended by your comments. While I dont agree with Ms. Jacksons opinion, I certainly dont agree with your hatemongering either. This country was founded for religious and political freedoms, many of which are being taken away from us while we continue to focus on race. We are all so busy pointing fingers at each other that no one is paying attention to what those in Washington are stripping away of our rights. While we are being distracted, Obamas little pen is signing every executive order and memorandum that he can get away with. Lets stop fighting each other and start fighting him over his lack of honor and respect for the people whom he is supposed to SERVE and not the other way around. Dont you see that this is a huge diversion from what is really going on? They have it so rough. nothing but a money grab from this racist bitch. Well, clearly its not appropriate that we allow such a violent and feral species to walk among our citizens unleashed and or unattended. Its just too dangerous. What do you suggest, state sanctioned segregation? Are you a complete A$$ or are you that stupidly ignorant? She certainly must be older than she looks! People dont have to say insulting things about blacks or whites. The truth is that propaganda is very powerful. The Communists used it better than any other group and the elite liberals in America have studied and practiced those forms of propaganda. The power of it is that people believe the lies, they believe the pictures painted that make them believe that the government is going to take care of them and that through handouts their lives will be improved. This propaganda is rarely attached to quantifiable data or facts, often there is is little truth in them. But, it does play with emotions and unthinkingly people tend to trust these people when, in fact, they are only out to protect their own interests, not the interests of the people they say they support. The lie is, by taking handouts you learn nothing, you remain unchallenged and you steadily need more to keep up. When you ask for more it turns more into begging and whining. What we need for the poor is not to out distance them economically as the liberal elite would do, you need to give them the tools to improve themselves. Jobs and training for those jobs, a desire to learn and become educated so that you dont just hear the politicians, but you listen and understand. Less government subsistence because those on government programs should be the disabled, the veterans, the elderly, and those who are TEMPORARILY in need. Welfare mothers (those who have more children to increase their welfare payments) should slowly be phased out. We do not have the responsibility to be the welfare country for the world and all of these illegal aliens need to be turned away, and we dont need to feel guilty that they came here from their own impoverished countries. We are not responsible for them. We can feel empathy for their hardships, but we have so many issues within our own borders that taking on the world responsibilities only makes more hardship for our own impoverished citizens. You can use the victim card only so long, then not being able to improve your situation becomes your own fault. Many immigrants came to this country in less than ideal circumstances, with only the clothes on their backs, some in servitude for debts to foreign countries. Many slaves, in actuality, during reconstruction were given small plots of land, some were given monetary compensation and other instances of opportunities to share crop, this is a whole lot more than being here with no relatives, very little comprehension of English, and just the clothes on your back.. Or you can turn to the Native Americans who were in fact part of a program of genocide by the Europeans who were caught up in their manifest destiny. So I say to this politician, she needs to do some educating of her own understanding of where the black stands in America and if anyone owes anybody anything. It is my opinion that we do not. Semper Fi Shep, as always I completely agree with your analysis. My family came from share croppers. They were no better than slaves. Grandmother was forced to quit school to work the cotton fields. You didnt hear her screaming for restitution. I need help getting this circulated, everyone I know did not know about it, it is like our history is just written to make us look bad and the bad things that happened to us have been forgotten, for the gain of others obviously. White people need to get organized peacefully and legally to get our views expressed, that we do not agree with the oppression and defamation of our race. I agree! She really is an imbecile. Also blacks sold blacks.. Read about the Irish slaves from 1600s..Ill have to go look in my saves..Not that good on here, but will post it..Its true whites were slaves first. Just google Irish slaves.. Hey it is a liberal bastion! My ancestors didnt come to this country until 1900 and they barely owned the cloths on their backs! I like your opinion Mike, it hits the nail right on the head! If you have such a strong distaste for us so called white slave owners then why dont you go back where your ancestors came from. How Credible is this info? what are your resources? I never even knew this, that was some good info. Love! Yes and she wants to know about the US Flag on Mars also. If slavery exists today it is this fools enslavment to Tribalism/Socialism. Im thinking relocation of all the Negroid sub-species types to a Remember this she-boon represents a whole district of racist hateful nigger monkeys just waiting and wanting to kill or assault a White. We need to round up this she-boon and her nigger monkey flock and ship them off to a monkey reservation or preserve. They do not belong in a White country founded by White men for White people. Ms Jackson is a female with the same racist objectives as Al Sharpton, Jessie Jackson and Attorney General Holder. whites were enslaved to the blacks for nearly a thousand years and blacks owned other black slaves and still do today and women for sex. A black man owned the first legal slave in the united states and other free black men owned slaves and The USA only existed about 80 years before white people brought an end to slavery. What you probably did not know is that whites were slaves for nearly 1000 years to the blacks and it was not in trade they captured whites and enslaved them in 1780 nearly 2million if not more whites were enslaved. They will not tell whites this because they want to feel entitled to what we work for and they are racist. shes not a freed slave. shes still a slave to sin. I wish her the best of luck! How do people like this keep getting elected? I love reading about stupid people; and drones who cant think for themselves. Funny thing is, we all tell the world the logic regarding black slaves. For instance, blacks enslaved the blacks first; also, slavery was endured by many ethnicities, some of whom had to endure it longer and with harsher treatment. Dont get me started on the Romans. Oh, I just remembered something, how many of these racist African Americans are Christians or belong to a religion where you must forgive? Really there is nothing to forgive since it happened so long ago and nobody exists from that time, but they can at least use that religious rule to pretend intelligence and forget the past. The slavery thing is beyond played and idiots like Sheila Jackson do nothing but perpetuate the myth. Nobody alive today can be held responsible for something that happened well over 200 years ago and easy as it is for them to point fingers at white people, blacks in America owned and sold slaves, as did Native Americans. For that matter, they can start pointing fingers all the way back to tribes in Africa sold other Africans as slaves. Oh, and perhaps Ms. Jackson should look into the well documented Muslim slave trade that has gone on for hundreds of years and continues today. Since you are free Sheila. Thank a Republican. And her point was????? Except she is an Aunt Jemima living in the big house. Driving brand new cars and flying first class really makes you relate to the plight of the poor black folk. May not necessarily be true. Native Americans had slaves, usually captured enemies. My grandmother was half Cherokee. Damnnn It is a rare day when another member of Congress can out-ghetto Corinne Brown! The only thing that Sheila Jackson Lee is a slave to is her own Racist Stupidity! Nice going Houston. With a voters pick like this, there cant be much intelligent life there! Thank Goodness that Rep. Charles Rangel, D N.Y. is working on a Reparations for Slavery Program. Im patiently waiting for my check!! Please make it Tax Free!! Stupid low class bitch,this is what happends when you put an idiot into a position of power. Shelia Jackson Lee is an idiot! She gets re elected because the blacks are so STUPID they believe her crap or they vote for her because she is BLACK!!! I am so sick of these fools and their lies I could scream!!! My ancestors never owned slaves. My mother was American Indian. Dizzy Twit! ",3
2,"Taxpayer Cash Down The Drain: The EPAs Posh Office Furniture As if the mere existence of most of the Environmental Protection Agency wasnt enough of a tax money rathole now that the worst of the early twentieth century pollution and industrial mess has been at least identified and the clean-up at least started, and now that they have moved on to terrorizing law abiding citizens, it turns out that the bete noire of the federal government collectively has a thing for expensive office furniture: And where did our wayward federal agency acquire these lovely furnishings? Steelcase? Oh, no. No drab and cold manufacturer for these public servants. Try Knoll and Herman Miller, well-known high end office furniture makers. To the tune of over $92 million dollars. The furniture shopping sprees equaled about $6,000 for every one of theagencys 15,492 employees, according to federal spending data made public by the government watchdog OpenTheBooks.com. Six grand a person for furnishings? For six grand yours truly could clearance rack shop and fill the closets of fifteen needy people. While private companies and citizens face more and more hardship from government regulation, the EPA literally sits in the easy chair, said Adam Andrzejewski, founder of OpenTheBooks.com. The EPA cant relate to the financial hardships regular Americans face. Its Herman Miller furniture for the bureaucrats, but Ikea for the taxpayers. Ikea? Try garage sales and Craigs List. For this fleecing, The Washington Times gives the Environmental Protection Agency a Golden Hammer award for waste in Washington despite spending over $70,000 to have furniture moved just to replace carpeting in an office. EPA takes its fiscal responsibility seriously. As a result of GSA leases expiring, numerous EPA offices were required to move or consolidate space between 2000 and 2014. New furniture purchases provided the agency the opportunity to obtain space efficiencies, the agency said. And buy designer office furniture all at the same time. Yeah. ",4

2,"Democrat Slavery - Black Americans Deceived, Manipulated The orchestratedpolitical insurgency is shifting into high gear, with plans for a Democracy Spring financed by billionaire anti-American puppet master George Soros next month and his continued violent disruption of the political process. Racist hate will surely play a prominent role in the Democrat plans as they have in the past, through the manipulation of black people and others under the Black Lives Matter organization, Moveon.org and others. There are some black Americans who understandthat the Democrat Party and the communists that permeate it are the problem. They recognize that slavery is still alive in America and that the slave masters are not generally the Republicans but their Democrat wolves in sheep clothing. Alfonzo Rachel speaks to the issue of the Democrat institutionalized slaveryand how they have convinced many black Americans that they are representing and fighting for them when in actuality the opposite is true. They are still operating the plantation and it is through short-term support at a slave level, made possible by the confiscation of the assets of others and its subsequent redistribution, that it is made possible. That is both socialism or the early stages of communism and slavery. They only get to keep the free rewards of slavery so long as they keep voting in their masters into the big house. If they lose power, the free ride is over, a ride to economic and social destruction. The video, from last September, is even more timely and relevant today than it was when it was first relased. Things have gotten decidedly worse, by design of the Obama regime other interests, including Soros. His message and warning to his fellow black Americans is that they are being herded and manipulated and the Democrats have them under their control. There is a lot here that much of black America would find useful if theyre willing to listen.

2,"WELFARE. Youre Doing It Right, Europe The European Court of Justices landmark ruling on Tuesday has been dubbed by Prime Minister David Cameron as simple common sense and a good step in the right direction. The ruling on benefit tourism came about because of an appeal by a 25-year-old Romanian woman, who had moved with her 5-year-old son to Germany to live with her sister. Eliazbeto Dano, who had been convicted in Romania of petty theft, has been applying for social benefits since her move in November 2010. She never had a job in Romania and although she has lived in Germany for the past four years, has not been employed there, either. She was receiving 150 pounds per month in child benefit payments and about 100 pounds per month in maintenance payments. She applied at the local job center twice to receive basic provision benefits as well in the amount of 300 pounds per month. The job center denied her application both times due to the fact that she refused to take jobs the center suggested to her, even though they found her perfectly capable of holding a job. She then made a court appeal and the case was referred to Luxembourg. The court there rejected her claim, saying she had not really been looking for work. The European Court of Justice also said that jobless EU migrants who move around the continent living off of state handouts have no right to move to another country if they cannot support themselves, adding that free movement rights are dependent on migrants not being an unreasonable burden on the host countrys social security system. They declared in a statement: A member state must have the possibility of refusing to grant benefits to economically inactive Union citizens who exercise their right to freedom of movement solely in order to obtain another member states social assistance although they do not have sufficient resources to claim a right of residence. EU migrants who come to Britain are banned from claiming jobseekers allowance for the first three months they are here. For the subsequent six months they are allowed to claim, if they can prove they are actively looking for work although this is to be reduced to three months. After that, they must produce compelling evidence they are going to get work or they can be refused benefits. Labour backed the ruling, stating that only people who contribute to the economy should be able to fall back on the welfare state. Prime Minster Cameron said of the ruling in a statement: As Ive said, the right to live and work in another country should not be an unqualified right; there should be rules about restricting benefits and this is good news. Work Pensions Secretary Iain Duncan Smith also agreed with the ruling. This is an excellent ruling and supports our view that people coming to the UK who dont have sufficient resources to support themselves and would become an unreasonable burden should not be able to access national welfare systems, he said. great ruling, we need the same here in America!

2,"More Than A Dozen Children Shot Gang Style Attack It was just before 1 a.m. Saturday when Walter Vides got back to his south Bakersfield home from a late shift at work. Across the street, his neighbors daughter was throwing a house party with more than 100 people in the front and back yards. Minutes later, he heard a barrage of gunfire, then chaos. Kids as young as 13 were riddled with bullets, running to escape the two gun-wielding teenagers and a third who police suspect were tossed from the house party and came back for revenge. They injured 14 people, firing off more than 30 rounds into the night. They are still on the loose. When Vides looked out his door, he saw a 16-year-old girl shot in the shoulder fleeing across his driveway to take cover behind his garage, a 13- or 14-year-old boy bleeding from his leg trying to hop his fence and scores of others running for their lives. At least one party guest returned fire, police said. They believe the shootout in the 600 block of Stephens Drive was gang-related. Across the street, Vides saw a man lying in the gutter near a blue Chevrolet Tahoe who sustained a wound to his head, one of the most critical injuries that morning. Then people started screaming, Vides said. They were trying to run, looking for brothers, cousins. Another bullet grazed the head of a man named Jesse, who Vides said owns the home where the party took place. It ripped off part of his ear, Vides said. That man arrived home Saturday before noon, still in a hospital gown with a blood soaked bandage wrapped around his head. That mans daughter, who police say had her parents permission to throw the party but attracted unwanted guests by posting the event on social media, was also shot, Vides said. The early morning shootout marks the worst in the city this year as the number of violent shootings in the Bakersfield area rises to at least 50 since the start of April, according to a tally by The Californian. No fewer than two dozen people have died as a result, topping last years total of 15 gunfire-involved homicides across Bakersfield. While party-goers were standing in the street and in front of the house party, a vehicle drove up. Three men, described as black teenagers between 16 and 19 years old, exited, and two opened fire into the crowd, said Ray Pruitt, a public information officer with the Kern County Sheriffs Office. He said investigators were having trouble getting information from victims and witnesses, adding, We believe that people who were at the party know who these suspects are. While Pruitt said the victims appeared to be random targets, Vides said the assailants chased some party-goers down the street as they fired shots. About a block from the house party, police pulled at least one stray bullet from the passenger side of Cecilia Noriegas Toyota Scion, which took fire while parked in her driveway. Neighbors say the scene was chaotic. There werent enough ambulances to handle the 14 teenagers shot, and the three that initially arrived were being doubled up with victims, said a neighbor, Fred Lancaster. Investigators drew 32 yellow circles on the pavement of Stephens Drive, marking the spots where spent shell casings lay just a few yards from asphalt stained dark red. Thats blood, said Sandra Burton, who lives next door to the house where shots were first fired. The cars in her driveway were riddled with bullets, caught in the crossfire as at least one house party guest exchanged fire, she said. Sandras mother, Julie, heard rapid gunfire. Then, when she looked out her window, she saw people running in all directions. When the firing stopped, she spotted two screaming teenage girls lying in ruddy patches of dirt of her front yard. Julie said theyve only lived on the street for about two years, but that police frequently visit the house next door, where the shooting started. It sounded like a machine gun, said Susan Adkisson, who lives around the corner on Castro Lane and heard about 20 shots, a pause, then roughly 10 more. It was loud. When I heard the screaming, I knew something bad happened. Terrifying as it might have been, Adkisson said shes not fazed by the shooting. The neighborhood has been going downhill for years, she said, noting at least two shootings she can recall in the area in as long as she has lived there. Lancaster said this isnt the first time hes experienced a shooting in the neighborhood, either. He remembers a time when gunfire broke out at the end of the street on Belle Terrace. People fled down the road screaming, he said. ",4
2,"Yo, Feminists, Iranian Women Face Mean Consequences If They Arent Veiled Properly Where are feminists and the war on woman people when you need them? The chief of police in the Iranian capital of Tehran is now telling the women of his town to wear the veil of the nations faith or face consequences. From Clarion Project: General Teymour Hosseini threatened, If a (female) driver in a car is poorly veiled or has taken her veil off, the vehicle will be seized in accordance with the law, theIranian Student News Agency (ISNA) reported In addition, the woman will have to get a court order to reclaim her vehicle. So, no letting the wind blow through her hair, huh? Yeah, impounding property is not very nice, but not unexpected, either. These guys have specific expectations for women and the girls arent living up to them. Unfortunately, some streets of the capital have come to resemble fashion salons, Irans judiciary chief Ayatollah Sadegh Larijani said this week, questioning the tolerance that has led to such a situation. Yeah, that has a tendency to happen with women. The thing is, that since the hardline takeover in 1979, the women of Iran have bristled, and outright resisted the rules that say they have to be covered from scalp to toe while outside of their homes. Last year, a truly enlightening Facebook page blasted onto western consciousness titled My Stealthy Freedom where Iranian women post photos of themselves without head scarves and enjoying the freedom, however short lived, of being bare headed, something so many of us take for granted. These women, many times, only post photos of their backs with flowing locks of hair to their waists against remote backgrounds for fear of being identified. And now, in the comfort of their own cars, these women cant even be themselves. They have to be who the Tehran police want them to be. Why does this regime get a pass on the war on women? Impounding cars because a womans hair isnt covered just seems like a much worse strike against her dignity than trying to prevent women and girls from killing their children which mutilates the body and mind and haunts the mother for the rest of her life. This writer would say the war on women feminists have their priorities out of whack, but shes a Catholic so her opinions dont count. ",3
2,"Africans mull joint action against Boko Haram The African Union plans this week to discuss a possible multinational force to combat the Nigeria-based Islamic jihadist group Boko Haram as the militants attacks are spilling over into Cameroon, BBC reports. Ghanas President John Mahama said Friday he and other African leaders will talk about a way to deal permanently with the militants. He said he wanted African Union countries to produce a specific plan of action collectively to fight the terrorists This has to end. We have to make this terror end, he said. Boko Haram has taken many towns and villages in northeast Nigeria in a six-year insurgency and has begun threatening Nigerias neighbors in an attempt to produce an Islamic caliphate. We must find a way to act together to share information, to synchronise our strategies, to pool our resources in order to rid the entire African continent of terrorism, Mahama said, calling it a regional problem for African nations. We cannot stand by silently, idly waiting for the international community to intervene on our behalf. The most recent apparent Boko Haram attack came in the dark early Sunday, Jan. 18, during which dozens of people were kidnapped and four villagers killed. The attackers reportedly fled toward Nigeria, and Nigerian officials told Reuters that some 30 adults and 50 children ages 10 to 15 were kidnapped. Cameroons Information Minister Issa Tchiroma Bakary said between 30 and 50 were taken but an investigation is under way. They burnt to ashes almost 80 houses, he said. Attacked were the villages of Maki and Mada in the Tourou district near Mokolo city in Cameroons Far North region, about four miles from Nigeria. Boko Harams violence has been condemned by the United States, the United Nations and other nations. International aid organizations are working to help survivors. But international attention has been focused primarily on the terror attacks in Paris. The jihadists first gained international attention and condemnation after they kidnapped more than 200 girls from a school in Chibok, Nigeria, in April. Chad pledged troops to aid Cameroon after that country said it killed 143 of the jihadists during an attack on its military base Tuesday in Kolofata. A unit of Chadian troops reportedly arrived Sunday. The French government has suggested Chad, Cameroon, Nigeria, Niger, contribute 700 troops each to a multinational force, but little has come of that yet. ",4
2,"Peter Singer Says In Case Of Fire Leave The Baby, Save The Pigs Australian-born moral thinkologist Peter Singer is no stranger to controversy. Hes been stirring it up whenever he opens his mouth about babies and fetuses (same thing, really, the only difference is being in the womb). The man actually has said mothers should have the option to terminate a child after birth, although not in so many words. He is also an advocate of the idea that all animals including humans are equal and that animals should have equal rights. Singer is a humanistic atheist and even with that on his resume, he still gets invited to speak at major bioethics and philosophy meetings. The hope, apparently, is that people wont notice he philosophically opposes human reproduction. However, Singers viewpoints published in a Swiss newspaper in May got him uninvited to a philosophy festival in Cologne called phil.Cologne. Neue Zuricher Zeitung: You do not consider an infant to be more worthy of protection than an embryo. On the other hand, you do not necessarily ascribe a higher status to humans than to animals. Peter Singer: Belonging to the human species is not what makes it morally wrong to kill a living being. Why should all members of the species homo sapiens have a right to life, whereas other species do not? This idea is merely a remnant of our religious legacy. For centuries, we have been told that man was created in the image of God, that God granted us dominion over the animals and that we have an immortal soul. NZZ: If you were standing in front of a burning house with 200 pigs and one child inside, and you could choose to save either the animals or the child, what would you do? PS: At a certain point, the animals suffering becomes so great that one should choose to save the animals over the child. Whether this point occurs at 200 or two million animals, I dont know. But one cannot let an infinite number of animals burn to save the life of one child NZZ: How about yourself: are you useful enough? PS: Considering the influence Ive had, my choice of profession is justified. I have motivated people to think about reducing animal suffering and helping people who live in extreme poverty NZZ: Would you go as far as to torture a baby if this were to bring about permanent happiness for the whole of mankind? PS: This question is from Dostoevskys The brothers Karamazov; Ivan poses it to his brother Alyosha. I may not be capable of doing it, as it is in my evolutionarily developed nature to protect children from harm. But it would be the right thing to do. Because if I didnt, thousands of children would be tortured in the future. Unbelievable. There are actually people out there that think like this. Every species on earth that births young is programmed to care for offspring. If humans are to be equated with other animals, that should be a given. However, to give precedence in an emergency to livestock over a human infant is particularly swinish. No one with a properly formed conscience wants to see animals harmed or tortured unduly, but in an emergency, they are not human, no matter their place in their animal kingdom. What is interesting about this incident is that while Peter Singer is revered by such leftist media organs as the New York Times, and still gets invited to philosophical meetings, even the Germans will uninvite him when his words are simply too much for moral people to bear.

2,"Take Down The American Flag or Be Fined Robert and Judy Willits moved to Fieldstone Housing Addition in Greenfield, Indiana last Christmas. Robert is a Korean War veteran who was seriously injured in the war and fought alongside his brother Lester, who was never found and never came home. Over the summer, Willits built a flagpole in his front yard so he could proudly display the flag he fought and bled for along with the MIA flag, which he vowed long ago to fly until he finds out what became of his brother. Last month, after finishing his flagpole and proudly flying his flags, Willits received a letter in the mail from his homeowners association telling him he had broken the rules of the association and would have to either take the flagpole down or be fined. The Willits were shocked and outraged. I am not taking it down, Willits said. That flag is for the freedom of every person in here. It represents freedom. Lester is still out there. So Im going to keep it up. His wife, Judy, feels the same way. With the penalties theyve imposed on us, I feel its really un-American for somebody that is a 100% disabled vet, she told local reporters. A group of Hoosier vets demonstrated around the flagpole Monday afternoon to support the Willits familys stand. Willits responded that he wouldnt pay the fine and the flags are staying put. The HOA said they are still deciding what to do if the Willits continue to disobey. Both the Association and the homeowners have hired attorneys. My father is a purple heart veteran of the Korean War. I am a disabled vet of the Vietnam era. Any veteran should be able to proudly fly the American flag however and whenever he or she wants. This is another example of people who have to much time on their hands and seek some kind of dictatorial authority over others in order to make themselves feel important and be a legend in their own minds. Hang in there, Bob! America is with you on this. I am proud of him and his wife for there stand on the American Flag and the POW/MIA Flag. wish I was there to help support you all. they sound like Obama and other Dum asses. Im not even American, but if I lived in America Id hang my flag and Id tell them where to go FU HOA Why would he fly the flag of the US federal government which left POWs in Vietnam. This isnt even blind patriotism because that would be loyalty to the American people and they would demand the government obey us. No, this is blind government-worship fixating on some flag is a sign of low IQ. I would never participate in an HOA. Ever. Many HOAs can put a lean on your home and eventually take it if you dont comply with their rules. I understand some may not have a choice but I will live on the street before someone tells what I can and cant do with my property which is why I built my house on land far away from any neighborhoods to begin with. Regardless, its clear because of so many incidents like this lately its time to protect the flag under the law. I think we all know if it was a flag supporting Islam they would have never said a word. You are just a bad person to even make this an issue let alone keep fighting it. Karma comes around. If HOAS want to take the issue to that level then why stop there, lets go all the way. There should be a law that if ANY HOA violates any civil rights, then they should be considered anti American and its representatives should be fined not more than $2000.00 and or jailed not more than 180 days first offense. Second offense $10,000.00 fine and or 10 yrs in jail and the HOA be dissolved until another HOA can be established that recognizes state and federal laws and civil rights of the USA. With all these immigrants coming here you can expect this B.S. The come here, sponge off our government, and have no loyalty to our country. Mr. Willits, I am a vet too, and this is an insult to our country, and to those who have fought and died for it since the beginning of this country. Theres a flagpole in the front yard of a house I walk by occasionally. It has the American flag, and a Coast Guard flag flying below it. I was n the army, and I salute that flag everytime I walk by, as respect to our country, and to the man who flies it. I thank you for your service, sir, and Im deeply sorry for the loss of your brother. I hope hes alive, well, and that you will be reunited soon. I salute you both. Fuck the hoa, what a bunch of self richeous assholes, leave the guy alone Dont take it down. Every American has the right to fly the American flag! Fuck the HOA !! They are ALL a bunch of cry baby liberal retards. AT NO TIME ANYWHERE in this country should it be against any rule to fly the American flag. Bunch of communist assclowns. Probably some Muslim tard or something of that nature that complained that it offended them. I say GOOD I hope they get offended all the way out of this country. I will help him pay to keep the flag up if he looses , but the HOA is Bull Sh** !! READ ABOUT BECOMING AN AMERICAN CITIZEN!!!!!!!!! NO OTHER FLAG EXCEPT THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA FLAG SHALL FLY!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! PERIOD!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! Mr Willets, My Dad served in WWII, my oldest brother was drafted in the late 60s but never left the States. My Dad, I know is rolling in his grave, for the way you and ALL VETERANS are being treated. He is also rolling in his grave for the way people, INCLUDING AND ESPECIALLY THE AMERICAN citizens are treating the FLAG. I THANK YOU AND ALL VETERANS PAST AND PRESENT AND FUTURE FOR KEEPING US FREE. Paint a U.S. flag on the side of his house. We should all get together and inundate that HOA. We can get laws passed to protect the right for Gay and lesbian marriage but we cant protect the flag, the symbol of the country that has given them that right,,,what the hell is this country coming to? As I veteran myself I become more and more outraged at the American people, here is my answer, if you dont like the flag and what it stands for, TAKE YOUR ASS TO ANOTHER COUNTRY AND SEE WHAT RIGHTS YOU GET. I am sick and tired of the HOAs thinking they can bully anyone and anything around. I feel sorry for people who choose to live in them as well.. Whether today with their little committee that wants to tell you how to live your life and what you can do with your OWN home; whether tomorrow after the dung hits the fan and you find that same little committee thinks it is in charge and wants you to disclose and turn over any and all emergency supplies you prepared for the good of all, regardless of the fact they were too stupid to plan themselves for a disaster, these HOAs are really getting out of control on these power trips. They think it raises their property values? They are wrong. Why? Because I and MANY MANY other people will NEVER invest a dime in any place that has a HOA. Which means your so called property value is worth a lot less than if we all were interested in living in that location.. We need to get a law on record to slap all the hoa(s) that wont allow respectful displays of our Flag. Is there anyone that is really offended by the Flag? Stand em up for the rest of us to see! Preferably against a wall, blindfold optional! Youre good man! Just helpin out! *sips coffee in cheers*! Yes any HOA can make covenants of a subdivision that allow or disallow certain things and that includes flying flags. Does that make it right? Absolutely nit. But HOAs exist all over this country that have that specific covenant. The responsibility of a potential homeowner in a HOA subdivision is to read and agree to the covenants. The HOAs can and do file lawsuits and take out property lines against said homeowners if they violate a covenant. I know. I live in a subdivision with a HOA. We have oneits called the First Amendment. Freedom of speech..as in flying our flag. This HOA Board needs a visit from some motor cycle riding vets to put the fear of GOD in them and teach them some patriotism!!! Or do it the old fashioned way with tar and feathers! Donna, there is no HOA that can make a rule that is in conflict with a federal law that says the American flag can be flown anywhere. Interesting to see how long the present administration will attempt another illegal executive order to overturn that law. There already is one, its called The First Amendment I agree he should be able to fly any flag he wants, but if the covenants of the HOA state specifically that you cant have one in your front yard then as a homeowner in that subdivision he needs to abide by the rules and move his flagpole to his backyard. When you buy a home with an HOA you have to sign an agreement letter at closing that states you read them and agree to abide by them. His friends and neighbors should help him move it Lee I think you misread renees comment? o.O There has been an American flag flying on my house everyday day for decades and it will darn well stay there too. Im honored by Mr. and Mrs. Willits and Mr. Willits bother Lester. Thank you for your incredible service and I hope and pray your brother is returned to you someday. Fly high and fly pround to the red, white and blue! It is ignorant people like you renee that are on HOA boards. That is where the real problem is in America. Be honest: how high are you atm? Failure to stop ISIS early? Threatening to be fined because of OUR Flag? Now EBOLA? Get the fuck outta here, And take your lame ass peasant friends with you. Leave our american cars, money and clothes here before you go back to the shit hole you call a home sad that we should even have to consider this. It should NEVER be against the law to fly the American flag ANYWHERE in this country. I would NEVER move into a community or buy a house in one that had any say in what I do with and to my property! There are zoning laws to make sure homes, businesses, churches, and schools stay where they belong. There are trash ordinances to make sure appearances are kept up. Thats enough! I can see they want to make sure the value of their homes doesnt go down, but they get carried away with what they think is unsightly. When they make my payment, they have a right to tell me what to do with it! Until then STFU!!! One should read the rules for flying the Stars and Stripes. Google USA Flag Code. He owns his property and if the lawn area is held in common he is a owner of the lawn area and is entitled to fly the Stars and Stripes in front of his home. Maybe he should consider his legal options. It is my opinion that HOA that vote to demand that the American flag be taken down or the person displaying it be fined, should be taken out and whipped and I mean every member! I will most probably be censored here, but fuck them. how about this, AR|REST OF THE HOA people running it, for violation of the ADA laws, and the first amendment and most important , HIGH TREASON with the death penalty as it final destination then convict them of high treason , give them the death penalty and then carry it out on the court house stepsssssssssssss, THAT IS WHAT NEEDS TO BE DONE TO ANYONE WHO TRYS TO FORCE ANYONE TO TALK DOWN THERE FLAG,,,,,,,,,,,,,, NO MORE OF THIS CRAP TIME TO REMOVE ALL NEW LIBERAL SOCIAL COMMI NAZIIIIIIIIIIIIII DEMM OOO RATTTTTTTTTTT AND THERE OBAMA HITLER JR PRESIDENT everyone should demand justice EVERY ONE SHOULD DEMAND THAT ILLEGAL CRAPPPP GETSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSS DONEEEEEEEEE BY THE ARREST TRIAL AND CONVICTION I feel that the president had something to do with this as well , I think it is bullshit and Im glad they are refusing to take down the flag pole and flag. Sorry HOA but Federal Law prohibits you from banning, or fining a tenant for flying the American Flag. The law is on his side as is every other American Veteran! Freedom to Display the American Flag Act of 2005 One Hundred Ninth Congress of the United States of America AT THE SECOND SESSION Begun and held at the City of Washington on Tuesday, the third day of January, two thousand and six An Act To ensure that the right of an individual to display the flag of the United States on residential property not be abridged.

Vice President of the United States and President of the Senate. A veteran in Florida just won the same disgraceful action. Found a Federal law that holds up our right to fly our flags anywhere anytime. Hooray dont give up My DAD SERVED IN WWII AND I REMEMBER WAITING BY THE GATE FOR HIM TO COME HOME.NO ONE WOULD HAVE DARED TO SAY HE COULDNT FLY OUR AMERICAN FLAG..MY DAD IS GONE NOW BUT i WILL STAND UP FOR THE AMERICAN FLAG HE FOUGHT FOR AND THE FLAG THAT HAS MEANT FREEDOM FOR SO MANY.I WOULDNT LIVE IN A HOME THAT WOULDNT ALLOW ME TO HONOR OUR FLAG We need a constitutional amendment to.protect flag waivers and Christian monuments. what right have you got to interfear with this vet you really must be some real ignorant trash thats a right in the constitution and thats also a god given right you people need to stop your foolishness and grow up this is america you dont rule all you dont make up laws so back off This shouldnt even be allowed to waste our courts time. This man lost his brother to war and is a 100% disabled veteran..they should be kissing his ass!! Men like him are why pieces of shit even have the right to complain. When it comes to being patriotic to this great country..there should not be any rule that exists to be broken! The lame arguement is always If we allow one flag to fly we have to allow others as well. Bulls**t! No ethnic, other country, state, sports, etc. flags should be permitted to be fair to everyone. The United States of America flag should be flown everywhere, every day, period. No more PC bulls**t! WHAT THE HELL ???? WE HAVE A FLAG THAT HAS REPRESENTED OUR COUNTRY SINCE 1776 !!! AND THESE ASSHOLES WANT TO FIGHT A VETERN WHO WAS INJURED BADLY TO GIVE US THIS RIGHT ??? OH HELL NO !!!! START A PETITION AND LETS SIGN AND SHARE IT ALL OVER FACEBOOK !!!! THIS IS WRONG AND WE SHOLD NOT STAND BY AND LET IT HAPPEN OVER AND OVER AGAIN !!! you better let that man keep his flag, he earned it in more ways then one and should be able to keep it for more reasons then one Find out where these anti-American fuck s are and place 1000 flags on their lawn There are so many HOAs across America doing the same to home owners who want to display/fly the American flag. As long as the flag(s) is not shredded, and presented in good taste (as this veteran is doing) the HOA should not be involved. In fact, they should support the veterans. Hopefully the HOA will come to its senses. This is America and there is an inherit right to fly the flag of your own country. ",3

The shots were fired just before 10 p.m. Saturday. There were no reports of injuries. Bullet marks were found on the exterior wall of the building, and shell casings were discovered in a nearby alley, McManus said. Its been shot at before, but not in close relationship with anything like whats happened in Dallas, and we are not going to be targets, McManus said. We are not going to allow our officers to be targets. This is not open season on police officers here in San Antonio or anywhere else. Were not going to allow that to happen. The area near the building in the 300 block of South Santa Rosa was closed off as the investigation continued into the overnight hours. Several police cars were seen at a nearby corner blocking access to the area. ",1

It rained and produced bucket loads of corn from land that would have been producing something else, and the farmers took a bath. And the prices for other stuff was artificially high because the land was diverted to producing corn. What you subsidise?, you get more of! Housing prices took a hammering in 07-09 because Fanny Mae and Freddy Mac had been forced or subsidised to offer loans to people that wouldnt have ordinarily qualified. Resulting in a swollen market. House prices artificially rise. Once reality sets in house prices are slashed to re-balance. This resulted in the discovery of poorly qualified borrowers. What you subsidise?, you get more of! The drop in Poverty in the USA hiccupd in 1969 and then completely bottomed in 1973. Johnson introduced the War on poverty in 1969. Subsidising low income earners. Subsides poverty? Get more of it! What you subside?, you get more of! There are 57,000 Government Employees on administrative or otherwise justified leave. This costs $775m, of a $billion! If theyre on admin leave for disciplinary reasons? Why are they getting paid? Or more importantly, what you subsidise you get more of. Subsidise sub-standards. Subsidise immorality. Subsidise insubordination. Subsidise poor performance. Youll get more of it! From the Washington post Auditors found that supervisors used wide discretion in putting employees on leave, including for alleged violations of government rules and laws, whistleblowing, doubts about trustworthiness, and disputes with colleagues or bosses. Some employees remain on paid leave while they challenge demotions and other punishments. By the way? I wreckon thats all thatl be needed to squash Ebola! No? ",3

The woman had told police that a nine year old relative had called her asking for help as he had found his sisters, their mother and her boyfriend dead in the home. It appeared 36-year-old Samuel Morales had shot to death his 34-year-old girlfriend Xiomara Leon and her 18-year-old daughter Linda Gonzalez. Leons 13-year-old daughter Yasmine Zavala had reportedly been strangled, while it appeared Morales had turned the gun on himself. In a press conference Sunday, police chief Luis Soler said, we dont know exactly what happened out there. The nine-year-old boy who had called for help was reportedly not at home when it happened. After a brief time with CPS, he is now staying with relatives. Pictured Above: Samuel Morales, Xiomara Leon, and Linda Gonzalez.

2,"Best Friend Steals Winning Ticket We may hear stories about big buck winners of the lottery ending up in broken, tragic situations after a careless spending spree with their winnings. It seems to become a curse upon them. Segura Rubelin, 40 year old, almost got a share of the pot if he wasnt so greedy and selfish. He lived in the Bronx of New York and worked as acab driver, but he was saddled with big money woes. Segura swiped his buddys winning $50,000 Powerball ticket then tried to pass it off as his own, authorities said Tuesday. Segura Rubelins pal, Victor Castillo, didnt win the $1.5 billion jackpot that sent the nation into a fever pitch two weeks ago. But, the fortunate friend knew he had won enough money to tide him over for a while until he said the man who was like a brother to him snatched the ticket out of his hand. His friend grabbed it as Victor was reading the numbers off to his buddies. He had 3 numbers and won $50,000! Segura grabbedCastillos winning ticket and ran off to the bodega where it was purchased and came back with another winning ticket one worth a mere $4. He was my friend, but he is no longer, Castillo, 66, told the News through an interpreter. We were like brothers. He betrayed me. Im still in shock. Castillo, who also drives a cab, joined Rubelin and other drivers at a Bronx diner Jan. 14 the day after the historic Powerball drawing to check the winning numbers. Fortunately, they got it all on video and shared the evidence with cops. We saw everything on the videotape, said Wagner Cruceta, manager of La Fuerza, the Bronx bodega where the $50,000 ticket was purchased. Victor bought the ticket. The other guy came to check it but left. It was not nice. After Rubelin left the diner, Castillo tried to track him down at his mothers house, where Rubelin had been staying. After the investigation, Rubelin was arrested Tuesday and charged with grand larceny. Rubelins relatives said he was behind on rent for a Washington Heights apartment, where three of his kids live with their mother and grandmother. Weve been waiting on him to pay the rent we owe, said the kids grandmother Segunda Paduani, 65. If he would have had the money, he would have paid it. Hes always helped with the rent. What a late charge poor Mr.Segura Rubelin is going to have, after court costs that is. Stupid is as stupid does, as Forrest Gump would say. H/T: NY Daily News ",1

2,"[Watch] John Bolton on Obama Hiding Russian Nuclear Missile Violations, Would Make Him Look Bad Greta Van Susteren interviews former U.N. Ambassador John Bolton regarding the Russian situation generally and in particular the latest release of information that Russia has violated the Intermediate-Range Nuclear Forces, or INF, Treaty. Bolton says the Russians have been believed to be in violation of the treaty for quite some time but that the Obama regime didnt mention it because it was politically expedient not to do so. He believes that the only reason that the regime acknowledged the violations was out of fear the information was about to leak, which would make them look even more inept and submissive. Ambassador Bolton says he is aware of other treaty violations as well as probable chemical weapons violations. He calls the actions that Russia has taken in Syria opening the question of their compliance as well as that of Iran. As far as the sanctions imposed by the U.S. against Russia, Bolton labels them as marginal increases which will reinforce Putins view that he can do as he pleases in Ukraine. He says in that regard, the imposition of new sanctions may have been worse than no new sanctions at all.

2,"Mom complains about Bibles in her sons school, but local parents have THIS to say to her.... When Jessica Greenes fifth-grade son, Leo, brought home a bible from Cloverleaf Elementary school last Thursday, she was livid. She said her son told her that they were handing them out in class. We were in class, Leo explained. Our teacher said that these people have volunteered to hand out Bibles. I was just shocked the school system would do that. I tried to contact the superintendent, but he has not returned my calls. Apparently, so many parents were upset with her objection to the program, the school had to disable the public post and delete the comments.Some of the last comments read before the post was taken down from the page were, Youre outnumbered here, and I stand by Cloverleaf. What are they afraid of? Apparently Just Christians. They seem to be tolerant of all other religions. Especially radical Muslim extremists who would gladly separate their heads from their bodies for them. SoYoure a Normal Atheist. Ive no problem with that. I do have a problem with the Neurotic Control Freak ones though. Like FFRF. And you are ardipithecus The Koran? Funny!! Thought you were well versed? Why dont you tell me the difference between the old and new testament then? Must be well versed with a racist name like that. In pig Latin I believe that translates to Iggerne Itchre. And you tolerant progressives liberals are such intolerant self centered control freak A. Holes. Its not in the constitution idiot! No, I will be cremated and spread into the pastures of all the beef suppliers for the fast food industry. Then my ashes will be ingested by other minions so I can do my dirty work from my whirlpool bubble bath of acid and bile. I pity you! You lose all rationality when it comes to a fictitious character who is a homoerotic drunken pyschopath at best. Please point out where Im being intolerant. I respect the fact that you dont believe in God which is your right. I just question on why you feel its your right to throw away other peoples property. The First Amendment is directed to the Congress. That is the legislative body of the US govt which writes federal laws. It says nothing to state govt, local govt, school boards, etc. Further, each state is guaranteed a republican form of govt to govern their own affairs. That is why the State of Ohio successfully fought the atheists attack on their state motto, which is a verse in the Bible, With God, all things are possible. I WILL have a blessed day..and even though you dont believe, I hope you have one, too! And you are going to love dancing in the fires of hell. I pity you! Come visit my site and discuss why you believe in a fairytale. Free yourself from being delusional!: www . godisimaginary . com You can even come talk to me live! That is if you arent too chicken to debate ! Uhhh, okay. Pick a version, scripture you would like to discuss. I am actually well versed in the Holy Bible. please visit my site: www . godisimaginary . com Meanwhile, back on planet Earth keep on believing in the mythical man in the sky. Good for you! What was wrong with the old testament? Lol. You nutbags crack me up/ Says the intolerant one.. Thanks for playing! Thats not theft. It is doing the maids job cleaning up the litter/propaganda. You all fear people who dont believe in the mythical man in the sky you believe in Good luck with that argument. Jesus liked getting rammed in the buttocks with other mens ancient dongs. I am pretty sure the whole story was a farse to pass on to simpletons like your parents and their parents, etc The Lord? Listen to you. Do you know how f*king absurd that sounds? You offend only several billion people when you foist The Lord bllsh*t on people that dont believe in that nonsense. Alas, the world needs suckers like you and we thank you immensely for it! Your name means you are a rapist. Pretty cool! You are an Austrelopithicus. Another mythical man in the sky believer. The world was flat too, you know? HAhahahahaha! Clown. Okay looney guy who believes in a mythical man watching over you.. HAHAHAHAHAHA! Cooooocooooo! Nutball. Not lost. I am pretty sure your mythical man in the sky had nothing to do with anything I have done. You must have failed sex ed. It was free and the hotel doesnt charge you if you throw it away. Sometimes, I have used the back pages as rolling papers or azz wipes. The Bible is a racist, sexist, abomination of a fairy tale written by homoerotic psychopaths. NO. Michael Brown was a thug n!gger. He got what he deserved. Doesnt change the fact that you believe in a mythical man in the sky. Cooooocoooooo.. www . godisimaginary . com Have a blessed day! The fact that this was called unconstitutional and illegal shows what kind of idiotic people we are dealing with. Something that seems to be ignored by the leftist libtards when it benefits them is the Constitution. I would not like it, but based on the First Amendment of the Constitution, Musliims could start handing out Qurans at anytime in the United States And Ill bet youre the type who believe Michael Brown was an innocent upstanding citizen and not the dope smoking thug that he really was. Whos the delusional one here? ITS YOU!!! you should be arrested for theft and destroying the Holy Bible! You should be ashamed of yourself if you have a conscience. Amen.. u are just a uniformed confused lost Soul Hope u figure it out some Day before its too late God gave mercy on you my friend and HAVE A NICE DAY Rigger Nitch u are just a uniformed confused lost Soul Hope u figure it out some Day before its too late God gave mercy on you my friend and HAVE A NICE DAY The Constitution only state that there will be no government state religion ! Not that religion be banned from the public sphere ! If you think it isnt truth you are either stupid or ignorant. Ill let you pick which one. This lady needs to drop dead !!! U christians r such a kind, loving bunch. Your choice of a screen name renders you and your opinions irrelevant. Go away. No egg on anyones face but yours. You deluded leftists want things to be a certain way so badly that you think you can will it out of/into existence. You are sick people. me too sharon, ours were red and we got them at school every year they asked if we had one or wanted one nothing pushy, and it was our choice, to take, look, study or kick it to the curb, as a matter of fact thats where our bible study was held in the cafeteria at school three nights a week, and I remember it well, no-one complained or whined or threw a tantrum like they do now, Everything is a choice even to be a crybaby whiner wussy about everything, Buck up little campers find a f**ckin hobby crying is a bad one !!! over 20 and given them away!!!! People fear what they are afraid of!!!!!!!! Ok so freedom of religion is what America stands for right? Freedom in generalso if atheists are threatening to sue a school because bibles were voluntarily handed out, which means the students had a choice to take one or notdoes that mean we can sue the atheists because they are forcing their beliefs on us? Now forcing something on someone is a different story, but if it wasnt mandatory than there is no problem! I am a christian but I respect others who believe in whom ever they believe, I will give my 2 cents into it if need be, but I still will respect whatever you may believe inbut Im not going to try to eliminate something just because I dont believe in it! That is our freedom, that is what makes America America! We deserve a right to our freedom, just as much as everyone else does! That is awesome. you are a moron What if the child and parents were Buddhist or Hindu? Thats a slap in the face to all other religious or non-religious people. Why force religion upon people. Its a calling or a choice, people deserve the right to choose what religion they want to become a part of. Teach them everything. If anyone has seen the movie life of pi you dont have to just choose one god, its your life and you do as you wish with it and its no one elses business how they live it. no it says Congress shall make no law respecting an establishment of religion, or prohibiting the free exercise thereof; or abridging the freedom of speech, or of the press; or the right of the people peaceably to assemble, and to petition the government for a redress of grievances. says NOTHING about keeping religion and government separate No one handed a Bible to the boy. He asked for it. Shove atheism up your ass soldier! I suppose you only joined for the money and not to protect the 1st amendment? dont let these people intimidate you. i have no problem with the gideons , or their mission to hand out bibles. however, since their were minors involved, the school should have probably sent home ( in the very least) a letter informing the parents that this program would be occuring, or permission slips to participate. that would apply to all religious books, manuscripts or tracts including the watchtower and the koran.i dont think the founding fathers ever thought that our country would be so diverse,that we would rip ourselves apart arguing over religious freedoms. Or his fornicating, boozing and shooting dope. Cant stand to see a Bible while indulging in sin. Exceptits not. The First Amendment simply states that the government shall not establish a religion that it would govern by or force people to accept, and that said government shall not stop anyone from the free practice of the religion of their choice, even in public, government buildings. So, how does that egg feel on your face? actually, the Separation of Church and state was to keep Governments nose out of the Churchs business! It was until the First Liberal Supreme court changed and misconstrued it! Remember that MY forefathers (besides my Cherokee forefathers) came here to escape the Governments, aka King Georges interference with the Church members rights to worship in Europe.. Do yourself a favor, open a History book that was written before Liberalism started tearing and falsifying facts Actually idiot they are spreading hate, theyve been spreading hate for years only difference is theyve come out of the closet the last few years and are more open about it, where in the Constitution does it say their to be kept seperate? And it sure as hell doesnt say anywhere in any law that a bible cant be passed out in a public place, bottom line here moron is if you dont want something you dont have to take it, its a personal choice not a government choice, good day. They are not spreading hate you moron! They simply are stating its the law religion and government are to be kept separate by law its in the Constitution! I am not here to argue about the bible. Thats off topic. We have rights in this country. One is freedom of religion. If you know your history you know many original European settlers came here to worship God without an oppressive government telling them how and where. What the constitution never discussed was separation of church and state. Nowhere does it hint at that. So public officials should be allowed to pray in public. We are allowed to pledge allegianceunder God, and we can have bibles handed out at school for those who wish go participate. Nothing is being forced upon us. Well, except for the myth of what is separation of church and state. And the other 1/3 has not been discredited, though there are those who have tried for centuries. With your name alone , you are a coward and a racist.. I wonder what her argument will be if ISIS ever gets ahold of her. Or any Islamist for that matter. Wow, talk about judgmenttell me, why do you have the name Loki? Are you aware that he was considered a god associated with magic and fire? Yet you are a Christian and putting others down who pray for JUSTICE and moving people out of their lives that are not good for them? Same difference. My daughter prayed for the Lord to move all the people out of her life that would hold her back from Him. All the people that were not good for her. So whats the problem with that? You didnt like her choice of words? Do you say everything perfectly? I meanyou DO know that God has this uncanny ability to look into the heart of a person and know what they are really feeling and thinking dont you? God help YOU should your prayers be IMPERFECT! You are one sad piece of work. Although you dont believe it, Jesus died for you too. You really need help. I bet you are one cold hearted person, having no compassion or sympathy, no empathy or moral compass. I hope you arent married or have childrenbecause if you don;t know the Lord, you are incapable of love. Made you should be pro active just take your child out of public schooling altogether, Jessica. Id hate for him to voluntarily bring home another bible to you. Youre nothing more than an antagonistic, media seeker. WHY should the superintendent take time out of their day to deal with YOUR overly sensitive ass WHEN there are legit issues to deal with; yours not being one. As long as were doing clever wordplay here, shouldnt your name be BIGGER Nitch? You are entitled to your own opinion and we are entitled to ours (in spite of you and the FFRF). Supt. Harper should respond to the FFRF and tell them to fold it and stuff it in your broom closet! Im not sure as to the truth of the word. I have faith which means I believe without the need of proof. But if you want it, there is plenty to be found. Two thirds of the Bible can be historically verified. If thats not truth to you, you seriously need to re-evaluate the meaning of the word. After a little research and some speaking legalese Ive determined that what the school did falls within the limits of their jurisdiction. There is NO statement or amendment in the constitution that remotely states that a Bible can not be given away at a public school. On the contrary, this fall under the premiss of RELIGIOUS freedom. The students had a choice to accept or refuse a Bible, there was no collusion only decision. My hats off to the superintendent for allowing this to take place. This Jessica Greene probably thinks Obama is the greatest too. That would explain a lot. I have the one the Gideons handed to my dad as he was boarding a ship to take him to Europe in 1943. The Germans allowed him to keep it after he was captured and put in a POW camp. It is one of my most treasured memories of him. Rigger every word In the new testament is true, try to find any thing in it that is not true if you can read that is when will these atheists learn or understand that it is not freedom from religion it is freedom of religion. and no where in the first does it say the separation of church and stae I just WISH we were free from the freedom from religion foundation, they can go straight to hell with the QUEERS that keep rubbing their sex in everyones faces! Get it through your heads that your rights DO NOT BEGIN where MY rights END! And just who are you to call Christians DUMB ASSES ? I think if you want to look at DUMB ASSES look for the ones that put a MUSLIM in office as the President of this Nation and has brought may Muslims over here and is supporting them in every way. please do everyone a favor and got to one of the hotels and die quietly! you are as dumb as your picture! Please dont reproduce `oh but its ok to let Muslim principals of THEIR religion in our schools,personally i think we should teach them all about all religions,,,INCLUDING CHRISTIANITY AND WICCAN let them be EDUCATED IN WHAT IT MEANS TO BE WHAT THESE RELIGIONS TEACH,,,its stupid to let one be taught and one not,,its an all or nothing thing,,,teach them all or dont teach them any,,,i am betting with FACTS on these religions more will become atheists or nature based religions than any structured religion, I see you are making a play on words in your handle; unfortunately, are not acting like the second word play as there are no riches in your comment, but you sure are living up to the stereotype of the first! Shame on you, you are sad person and we know why . You have made your choice but you dont have the right to keep others from choosing. Ill pray for you! Then you have the right not to read it! Its not unconstitutional to do that ! Why is it that after reading all of the comments every Christian has provided a fact based, non-judgemental, non profane response? Yet the majority of the comments from the atheists are the exact opposite? If you are going to attempt to start something you cannot finish, please read the story and have your facts lined up. As Christians we are armored with the truth, and knowledge of Gods Word. When you guys change your minds, we will be more than happy to welcome you home with open and loving arms. Oh and Merry CHRISTmas ever pay by credit/debit cardthey charge youso how many bibles have you boughtyou big dummyhahaha it was the freedom of religionnot separation. If you dont like the school, please go and find you a mooslime school to go to..knock yourself out!!!! Her son had to go to the library and asked pacifically for the free Bible hand out to get the Bible in the first place so her son must have been interested in learning about God and Gods word so let him make his own decision where his religion lies and stop trying to take his rights away if youre so concerned about peoples rights then let the boy have his he may only be in the fifth grade but he is smart enough and he knows enough to know what he wants to learn about so let him learn it this is America . Your delusional if you think its not, now go back to your mentally challenged atheist group and spread your hate elsewhere and just like the woman said, you are outnumbered. Merry Christmas. Niggar Nitch Boy I Tell You The Holy Word Of God The Bible Has Fools Like You Running Scared Big Time Bro. The Reason Is You Cant Handle The Truth!! Thats the problem with this country, they came here for freedom of religion, and was fought for and established with the words under God. If you idiots dont like it get out and go where you can believe like the muslims. If you dont believe in God you are just as bad as those believe in false one. So just shut up. Hes also a thief. Hes throwing something that doesnt belong to him. What would you gain by throwing the bibles away? Even if you dont actually do it just by boasting about doing it all youre doing is showing people how close minded and intolerant you are. I understand that you dont believe in the bible and its teachings. Thats your choice but it just doesnt mean you are right. Remember the world doesnt revolve around you or your thoughts. And if you think the communist manifesto is truth, you are delusional. Atheists already have freedom from religion so what are they bitching about. I am a Christian and I dont say lets have freedom from Atheists. Bible really means: Book Of Books. What are Atheists afraid of? All roads lead to God, but only one leads to heaven. I feel sad for someone that makes a statement like this without studying the Bible. What do we as a nation expect? We have taken prayer and Bibles out schools, (even at free time, or, is it really free time?), we have taken down crosses which are memorials to the troops that have died over the years for our freedom, we have taken down the Ten Commandments, we buckle to every atheists complaint, we have turned our back on God. What do we expect? Unfortunately, we have banned Bibles and prayer in schools, even at free time. (Is it really free?), We have torn down crosses which stood for the troops that have died for our freedom, we have torn down the Ten Commandments, we buckle every time an atheist complains about a nativity scene, this country has turned its back on God. What are we to expect? During your homosexual encounters, Im sure. Liar. We will see who is delusional when we die. If you end up in front of Jesus Christ on judgement day and he sentences to to an eternity of frying in hell then all I can say is You were warned! Wow. Im saddened what I see in our country today, especially out of the govt, and our schools, and quite a few of our citizens. Our country was founded on Christianity (this is a fact, not a belief). But that by no means says you have to believe in it. But just because you dont, and you have freedom of speech, doesnt mean you should try to limit the rest of us from practicing our beliefs (publicly or privately). If there is something so bad about Christianity that it makes you feel in this manner..by all means, look away; close your eyes, wear ear muffs, or better, just go away, somewhere else. Were not forcing it on you in your home. Not even forcing it on you in public, but Ill be damned if your going to take my rights away because you dont agree with them. He had the option of not picking up the bible, he didnt take that option. Teach your child better, or give him the option of making up his own mind. Dont sue a school (taking time and money away from all of our children) because not everyone will confirm to your back way / mis-informed beliefs. Everyone has to be right, and no one is right unless they believe the way I believe. Is this really the attitude that we are going to stick with? What happened to our society? Oh wait.I already know. Lack of God. But some of you wont believe that, and its fine. If you dont think its truth you Sir are extremely delusional. Loki5308. Its people like you who misread things or only pick out certain parts and dwell on them. Without going back and re reading the sentence, please tell me exactly what was said. Bet you cant can you. That person was neither a friend of mine nor a family member and I said I had made a joke. I did NOT say that he should choke on it. I am neither smug nor hateful for no reason and our prayers have been answered is a often used as a figure of speech. If you believe that handing out bibles is unconstitutional then you obviously have not read our Constitution! A bunch of people lose their sh#%t when it comes to the magical man in the sky. All rational though is thrown out through the teachings of Jesus Christ. Trust me when I say, there are more of us non-Christian/Catholic than you. Congratulations on offending millions of people! I throw away the bibles they leave in hotels. If you are missing one in your room, thank me Truth-hating? If you think the Bible is truth, you are delusional. Funny how the left will wet its pants over this but they are totally fine with making kids study Islamic culture and the Quran. And when people raise THAT issue they are called intolerant. IMAGINE THAT !!!! Maybe you should learn and comprehend what was said. She didnt say she prayed that he would choke on it. Just made a joke that God may make him choke on it. What does not make sense is that if we (as Christians) offer a free, voluntary way to let children read the bible, we get bashed. Charges are brought against us. Yet in the school system, evolution/science is promoted, yet no one bats an eye at something so common. I admit, I am young to be writing on the subject (high school senior), but I see the impending doom that Christians have in society. It is only a matter of time before we repeat the words Paul Harvey eloquently wrote, Our father, who are in Washington. I have faith that somehow the youth in our society and can a change for the better. Jesus saw what we were going through and he blessed us the following March when the Atheist decided (after we quit being his ATM) that he no longer wanted his girlfriend or his child living with him and kicked them out without a cent nor a place to live. The only contact he had was to tell my niece that he wanted to relinquish all parental rights to his now 6 year old child so he wont have to pay child support. Its amazing how people pick up on one little thing that has nothing to do with what was going on in the school and make a big deal out of it. Besides, it was a joke, God was the one who made it happen. I guess God needed a good laugh too. Maybe if more Bibles were handed out in schools, there would be fewer of them handed out in prisons. I think that you must be Atheist. You dont know the entire story behind praying that he would leave. He was never part of the family to begin with as he never married my niece when he got her pregnant at 16. He was a very abusive father to my great nephew and an abuser to my Niece. He was a user so he didnt have to work. These people need to limit their religion to the home or their churches, and out of public school. That goes for any religion, whether it be Christian, Judaism, Islam, or whatever..Keep thy religion to thy self. The bibles werent handed out, they were taken voluntarily by the children that wanted one. No one forced the child to take it. Im a atheist but I dont see a problem with it its voluntary as long as they are not making them take one if my kid wanted to take one and read it I would not care if thats what he wanted that why we live in a free country Maybe if they start handing out more bibles and less condoms, the title wave of cultural decline can be reversed and we can get back to becoming a nation producing young people living with a value system beneficial to the world at large instead of living by the natural instinct of the moment leading mostly to self-pleasure and the destruction of values that doesnt hurt anybody if they are upheld! Clearly he wasnt a member of the family, but an outsider atheist who was trying to force his beliefs on a devout family. He deserved to choke. I too would laugh and laugh and laugh and laugh and laugh and laugh and laugh and laugh and laugh and laugh and laugh and laugh and laugh (well even you should get the picture by now). If he wants to believe in nothing he should stay with those who feel the same way. Oh and eat more carefully!!! I was thinking the same, in fact I know a couple atheists who did just that. They also used to be Obummer supporters. They figured out their bad judgment there too! The WORST part of this is that most of you morons are NO different than shitbag liberals. Listen Rob Adams, I am a conservative for the most part, but I am also an atheist. I served my country for 21 years. I am not oppressive truth hating or anti-Constituional. Your fucking religion has its fucking place-no fucking different than every other religion in the world. Hand a bible to my son at his PUBLIC school and youll get it shoved up you ass. How very predictable . . . a straw man argument, unsupported supposition and childishly laced with profanity and groundless insults. Outstanding job of proving the stereotypes about atheists. Even sadder is that there are at least five others like you. The three page letter from the atheist should be used for toilet paper. Its time they and the ACLU stopped trying to run our lives. Too funny The note is real and taken out of context.the note was NOT in the constitution and never ment to be. The purpose was to support free religion. The past the king dictated who and what God you have to serve. The original poster cited the Federalist papers as its source, and that is not true, at all. If people use that argument, they will lose the bigger argument every time. Like Christine Lee has pointed out, it is important to cite the correct source. No matter when Christ was born, Christmas is the celebration of his birth. Get more logical arguments. The non Christians are. They are handing out bullshit a d the Christians have to give up their traditions and beliefs. So if you stop me from practicing my belief its ok??? Youre pushing your Atheist beliefs on the majority of the people. The Bible does say, Dont be unevenly yoked. If a Christian and a an atheist marry, there will always be tension when it comes to Jesus. So to pray that relationship doesnt work out, is not hatefulness. But it does make good sense. You are talking about a private note he wrote. It is not in the constitution. The sole purpose of the note was to protect the church. And to protect people from past kings ruling with church rules. It is so you can choose to believe or not to believe. No, it is called being tired of getting slammed because liberal tolerance doesnt go both ways Yeah, Im Christian Doesnt mean Im a saint Its best that your son gets a bible now or later in prison , even your courts and most meeting NA, AA is believing in a higher power than yourself so get over it atheist P.O.S. look at that lady that started the atheist movement she stole money and her and her son was found murdered , we followed yalls ways and look how this world is turning the past 20 yrs so screw the atheist go be with ISIS and no leave us Christians alone , dont like our ways move to Syria Fannie you do sound like a nasty soul, I am sure jesus is very impressed by you. I dont observe Treaties and youve changed the subject anyhow. The Constitution is the law of the land. Go back in history a little bit more. Youre missing the point. Our Founding Fathers did not wish to have a Government religion as England has the Anglican Church. When Kings would kill you for being Catholic (or not being Catholic) or anything other than Anglican. Youre changing the subject. No Christian is screaming about other religions in school, per se, Were simply correcting your flawed wishful thinking and letting you know there is NO SEPARATION OF CHURCH and STATE in the Constitution. Your Treaty is a lie. And, we know that Treaties can be harmful and wrong. Our Founding Fathers were not deists. They believed in God and wanted us to worship freely like free men do. No one knows the date of the Birth of Christ. No one has stolen the birth of Christ. We observe it on December 25. When you dont know the exact day, you pick one. We observe Memorial Day, even though our veterans did not all die on that day. We observe Presidents Day when not all our Presidents were born on that day. You seem to confuse Christians (imperfect) with Christ (perfect.) Christians are not Christians because were perfect and sinless. Were human beings who have given our lives to Jesus Christ in a pathetic attempt to live a perfect life like He lived. We make mistakes. He without sin, cast the first stone. Youve lied, youve cheated, youve had lust in your heartyou too are not sinnless and you need Jesus. Its important to have the correct source when debating an issue. Audieho is correct on the source. Some people would complain if they were hung with a new rope. YAHWEH LINCOLN PARK MINISTRY, HILO, HAWAII: YAHWEH LINCOLN PARK MINISTRY, HILO, HAWAII: When I entered boot camp for the Navy in 1990, we were issued a Dity bag that contained stuff like razors, mouthwash, toothpaste, etc There was also a brown New Testament from Gideons. I still have it and even carried it with me while in Bosnia in the mid-1990s. Not entirely true. The phrase separation of church and state is from a letter written by Thomas Jefferson to the Danbury Baptists. During Washingtons two terms and Adams one term as President under the Constitution, they would frequently make religious proclamations. Thomas Jefferson would often argue that the practice reminded him of something King George would do. When Jefferson ran for President against Adams, Alexander Hamilton, a friend of John Adams, began insinuating that Jefferson was an atheists based on his claims about the religious proclamations and would ban religion if elected. When Jefferson won the election, many religious groups panicked, fearing the worst, so the Danbury Baptists wrote Jefferson to question if he intended to prohibit the free exercise of religion. Jefferson responded back that he believed the Constitution created a separation of church and State that prohibited him from prohibiting their religious exercise. He never once suggested the practice of Adams and Washington violated the First Amendment and it was never meant to restrict the people, even when working for the government. Wow talk about hatefulness. You prayed that your Atheist family member or friend would no longer be part of your family and thought it was funny that he choked on it? Very Christian of you. Also, Christmas and the majority of its traditions are stolen. The birth of christ, according to all of you own religions research, isnt even in December; so go ahead and keep being needlessly smug and hateful for no reason. you religious believers are stupid crazy with your beliefs and what the constitutions has in it about church and state . youd be screaming if some non christian religion was handing out anything. and the founding fathers were specific that no religion was to be supported by the government. The Treaty of Tripoli, states that the Government of the United States of America is not, in any sense, founded on the Christian religion[25] and was passed unanimously by the Senate and signed by President John Adams. 1st amendment guarantees freedom of speech, means youre going to let Muslims hand out Quran too if Christians hand out bibles dumb asses Good for the good people in this town who STOOD UP to this BULLYINGthats what we need more of we have been bullied into removing so much about Christianity from every area of our lives - its opening the door for a worse thing to take its place its exactly what the radicals want no Christianity and a division amongst AmericansSTAND together the library has many many books some I want to read, others Im not so interested in..you know what? I just dont check out those books.her son evidently was interested in what the book had to saycant fault him for that If I read correctly, the bibles were in the library and were free to anyone who wanted them. Obviously this womans child wanted one or he wouldnt have taken it. Call it the curiosity of a child if nothing else. If she got her nose bent out of shape over a Gideon Bible wonder how her precious Leo is going to react when they dont have Christmas. After all, isnt Christmas about the birth of the Christ Child? As for the Atheists, just go away. Believers outnumber you. Matter of fact, last Christmas we had a self proclaimed Atheist at our family table. We have a custom of passing around Oplatky (from Slovakia) with honey on it. I made a joke that he didnt have to take it because If they were handing out Qurans and you didnt take one, someone might be waiting outside to cut your head off. Im just saying. I can still remember the day the Gideons came to my 4th grade class and gave each of us a tiny white Bible in a box . I still have that little Bible in the original box and will keep it til I die which probably wont be too long because Im 68 and that is still one of my fondest memories from my school days. Well, handing out Bibles is part of our first amendment rights. Heck, even our founding fathers, the ones who actually WROTE the Constitution bought Bibles to be handed our in school. This atheist, as well as countless others, are nothing more than oppressive, truth-hating, insecure, anti-constitutional, and anti-American bigots. Separation of church and state is nowhere in the constitution. That is a remark that is in the federalist papers. It wasnt included in the constitution because it would make it that religion could not be the guiding light to our government and our founding fathers didnt want to inhibit religious influence in government so they wrote in the constitution instead congress shall make no laws establishing a religion, nor prohibit the free exercise there of. They didnt want the government to make you practice any particular religion but they also wanted to guarantee you the freedom to exercise your religion freely publicly and privately. It never limited when or where it could be exercised. ",3
2,"UN Plotting Ways To Circumvent Caps, Dump More Syrians Into US The fact that the United Nations, not the United States makes the determinations as to who will be given applications for asylum in the US is wrong-headed and dangerous. Americans should be deciding who and in what numbers is allowed in through the actions of our perpetually inept Congress. The UN has given their agents of intrusion a lofty, regal-sounding title, the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR). They could just as easily have called it the human trafficking and importation office but that would have made their task of fabricating a false perception of legitimacy much harder. In pursuit of doing whats best for them, to move as many individuals from the Middle East to the US, terrorist interns included, the UNHCR is now considering alternative ways to slip more Syrian refugees refugees past the American people. They cant meet the assignment Obama gave them in his fundamental transformation at current levels. Even at the new accelerated pace of importing 10,000 Syrians by September, and even more thereafter, it could take decades to create a North American Caliphate. The UN is coming up with another plan. Senior Researcher Nayla Rush of the Center for Immigration Studies, warned on Monday that the UN is going to use other methods of infiltration for the refugees, including not calling them refugees and padding the numbers of other programs. They might even amount to convenient admissions detours at a time when the U.S. refugee resettlement program is under tight scrutiny, she said. Detours is a deceptive and polite way to say circumvention or flagrant disregard for American laws and policies. She theorizes that, faced with a target of relocating 480,000 Syrian refugees into the west over the next three years, the plotting is already underway. She says the UN representatives are already laying the foundation for of a false appearance of legitimacy. She notes that During a panel discussion at the Brookings Institution in February, Beth Harris, Research Professor at Georgetown University and adviser to the United Nations Secretary General on humanitarian refugee policy raised the possibility of alternative paths, directly targeting the US. Ms. Rush cited comments by the UNHCR in which they stated, Refugees and government officials are expecting this crisis to last 10 or 15 years. Its time that we no longer work as business as usual UNHCR next month [March 2016] is convening a meeting to look at what are being called alternative safe pathways for Syrian refugees. Maybe its hard for the U.S. to go from 2,000 to 200,000 refugees resettled in a year, but maybe there are ways we can ask our universities to offer scholarships to Syrian students. What the UNHCR is advocating an abuse of power that they shouldnt even have. Theyre not the US; theyre the UN, a foreign globalist entity that has no legitimate authority over the Constitution and the American people. They also proposed Tweaking some of our immigration policies to enable Syrian-Americans who have lived here to bring not only their kids and spouses but their uncles and their grandmothers. There may be ways that we could encourage Syrians to come to the U.S. without going through this laborious, time-consuming process of refugee resettlement. Rush described how the UNHCR himself, Filippo Grandi, had called for alternate avenues during a high level meeting in March. He suggested possible pathways as being not only through their resettlement but also by means of more flexible mechanisms for family reunification, including extended family members, labor mobility schemes, student visa and scholarships, as well as visa for medical reasons. Resettlement needs vastly outstrip the places that have been made available so far But humanitarian and student visa, job permits and family reunification would represent safe avenues of admission for many other refugees as well. Rush also noted ominously that after that meeting, Hussein Obama made another of his personal pledges that is a precursor of future dictatorial actions. He said, The United States pledged an additional $10 million to UNHCR to strengthen its efforts to identify and refer vulnerable refugees, including Syrians, for resettlement. He added, The United States joins UNHCR in calling for new ways nations, civil society, the private sector, and individuals can together address the global refugee challenge. Additionally, the United States has created a program to allow U.S. citizens and permanent residents to file refugee applications for their Syrian family member. The only changes we Americans are interested in are those that tighten immigration policies, return to a genuine enforcement posture and control of the process being returned to American hands. Theres one Kenyan and one Canadian who need some particular scrutiny and likely detention for immigration and election fraud. As patriotic Americans, well gladly handle those proceedings ourselves.

2,"Jamie Lynn Spears Knife Fight Sweet little Jamie Lynn Spears and a friend went out to get something to eat last weekend at the Pita Pit in Hammond, LA. What started as a quiet night out ended in a brawl. Spears friend was attacked by another patron and a huge fight began to ensue. Quick-thinking Spears jumped to the rescue, grabbing her friend and dragging her behind the counter. Spears then grabbed a huge serrated knife and ultimately ended the fight. I have been with Pita Pit for several years, and have never seen anything like this before, restaurant owner Jack J. Brighenti tells E! News. The events that happened occurred after 2 a.m. this past Saturday night just before we closed. A group of males got into an altercation and for some reason Jamie Lynn Spears ran behind the counter and picked up a bread knife. Spears friend did not press charges and no arrests were made. Thanks to Spears quick thinking everything ended before it became truly out of hand. THIS IS STUPID. ",1
2,"Boa Emerges from Toilet In San Diego, Stephanie Lacsa got the surprise of a lifetime when she went into the womens restroom at work on Wednesday. Lacsa noticed that the water in the toilet was higher than normal, so she grabbed a plunger. That is when she noticed something brown coming out of the toilet. And it just kept coming. As soon I saw the flicker of its tongue, I definitely knew that it was in fact a large snake heading straight towards me, she said. As to be expected, Lacsa ran screaming from the bathroom! Animal Care and Control was immediately called. The officer called out had never dealt with anything like that before. No one is sure how the 5 foot boa ended up in the plumbing. Holly Wells, who also works in the building blames it on the old building. Our building, which is the Old San Diego City Hall, was built in 1886, so we are accustomed to the old pipes and stubborn plumbing, Wells said. The boa was found alive and was taken to a local veterinarian for assessment. The hope is that the boa constrictor will be able to find a good home and stay out of the plumbing. To all of those who own a snake, put the toilet seat down!! ",1
2,"$500K / Day Illegal Housing One Center , $300K/ Day In Travel - DHS Is Screwing Amer The waste and mismanagement under Jihadi Jeh Johnson at DHS is criminal, a fitting characterization for the practices of a department run by the biggest scofflaw, anti-American operative in government, aside from Hussein Obama. Johnson is always quick to claim he cant do his job of border enforcement because his budget shortfalls require discretion. Its his waste, apparently deliberate, which create those shortfalls, a mechanism for him to fabricate a situation in which he has no choice but to ignore the law and allow illegal aliens to roam freely within the United States. The amount of waste is mind-numbing. According to an article in the Daily Mail, we taxpayers are on the hook to the tune of $300,000 every day for the costs of deporting illegal aliens on both commercial flights and private jets. ICE spent $116 million in 2015 alone in transporting 235,413 individuals back to their home countries, an average of $492 per person. Whatever happened to going Greyhound and leaving the driving to them? Nothing but the best is good enough for our illegals? Load em up, point the bus south, drop off the Mexicans at the border and continue on south to Central America. If the Mexicans dont like it or dont want to cooperate, start charging them a bounty for every one of their citizens we capture and have to repatriate as well as those of other nations that pass through Mexico en route to America. Theyll soon cease to be a problem one way or another. But the bulk of the expense is not the travel costs. Simply housing and supporting the illegals are much more and that doesnt include the costs that the states absorb. The figures that are available under Johnson, Obama and Congress Let the illegals in and screw the American people program are staggering. ICE quoted a number of $12,213 per illegal per year. Rather than simply deny the illegal border crasher access to the United States, Secretary Johnson and Hussein Obama have decided unilaterally that they will redefine the word refugee and grant every illegal a hearing at some far off date that most dont bother to show up for. That makes the American people, under their perverse liberal logic, responsible for supporting the border crashers until their hearing date. Thats insane. Some of the most egregious examples of reckless waste involve air travel for those being deported. In addition to the cost of flying commercial, some illegals are given private luxury jet flights back to their homelands, including on Gulfstream IVs. They even went so far as to charter a twin engine jet that is capable of carrying 261 persons to transport one single individual from the US to Nigeria. Wouldnt a military transport that was heading that direction anyway have been a more logical choice? The Daily Mail notes that such high-risk charters have happened on at least 34 instances, claiming it to be necessary because of the number of security personnel required. If the money was coming out of Johnsons personal bank account instead of the limitless US Treasury, Johnson would have long ago been on the phone with his old buddies back at the Pentagon, where he used to work, making arrangements to stretch those travel dollars. The president of the Taxpayers Protection Alliance, David Williams agrees, saying, This is insane. This is an outrageous and unacceptable waste of tax dollars. There is absolutely zero justification for spending this amount of money deporting immigrants. Theyre not immigrants, theyre illegal invaders, David, but youre right, its an outrage. DHS needs to find a more efficient way to do this, Williams said. Somebody at DHS should be held accountable for this. This type of wasteful spending is why the American people have such a high level of skepticism and cynicism about government, adding, Leave it to the government to take a relatively simple task and make it complicated and expensive. Another infuriating revelation is that the government pays $231 every 24 hours for every detainee housed in the system. With 2, 105 declared to be presently within the system at the South Texas Family Residential Center in Dilley, TX, the daily cost at that one facility alone that the American people are paying, strictly as a result of Jeh Johnson deciding everyone that sneaks into our country can be considered a refugee is a staggering $486, 255 per day, almost half a million dollars per day just at that one facility. ICE operates a large network of such facilities, according to the report, so the figure is quite large and totally unjustified. The cost of repatriating border crossers at the border is a onetime shot. This expense that Johnson and Obama have us shackled to through their detention centers is a never-ending budget buster designed to provide a negative associated with enforcement. But its not enforcement that is the problem. Its a slow motion capitulation to the open borders agitators and a mockery of true enforcement. It is not designed to succeed. It is intended to burden the system to the point of failure or to total collapse. That is the mission Jeh Johnson was put in place to accomplish. That is the job hes doing on the American people.

2,"Political Right Flocking To New Social Media Platform Now that the powers that be at Twitter and Facebook are flexing their proverbial muscles and are busy messing with search algorithms and deleting accounts of the alt-right for hate speech, a new social media platform is getting a lot of attention. Gab, a social media site where the first amendment is printed on the splash page, and the bug symbol is Pepe the frog (a Spanish name for the symbol of the French? Okay), was started in August 2016 in response to Breitbarts MiloYiannopoulos banishment from Twitter for harassment. The idea of the platform is to allow unrestricted free speech, other than pornography, private information, threats and terrorism. (Thats on the guidelines page.) The look and feel of the site is described this way by The Guardian: Looking like a cleanly designed hybrid of Twitter and Reddit, it allows users to post updates without character limits, with memes, links and gifs. The Guardian goes on to say that the site supposedly has tens of thousands of people on a wait list. This writer went to sign up, and this is what popped on the screen. Looks like a lot of conservatives got there before me. According to the confirmation email, it may well take up to two weeks to become a gabber since demand is so high, and the system is still in beta. Those who have been able to get in reportedly the service currently has tens of thousands of people on its waiting list will see that many of the most read and upvoted content comes from alt-right accounts that have long since been bounced from Twitter. As a result, spending time on Gab feels like hanging out with exiled ghosts. Its as if the political left did not think that the alt-right and other conservatives wouldnt go looking for another way and place to congregate online. (Do they really think we are that wishy washy and undetermined?) The Guardian, and a number of other leftist, and left leaning publications claim that Gab is basically a gathering place for white supremacy racists, but the founder, Andrew Torba, says no. Gab founder and CEO of the service, Andrew Torba, insisted in a gab that we welcome everyone and always will. But so far, you need to look pretty hard to find accounts not posting a pro-Trump line. Torba also says that it is not Twitter for racists. But there is no shortage of racially charged material to be found there. The motto at Gab is #SpeakFreely, and that does have to include racists (that doesnt mean that the other users cant vote the material down, though). So, who is speaking freely at Gab? Ann Coulter, Paul Joseph Watson, Richard Spencer of the National Policy Institute, and other familiar names on the American political right bannished from other social media platforms for the crime of supporting Donald Trump for president. Torba, actually, was one of the few Silicon Valley visionaries who was pro-Trump. The other people in the technological hotspot arent too happy with him, actually, and last week he was kicked out of Y Combinator, an incubation/venture capital/mentoring group that is considered to be one of the best tech company producers in the country. On Thursday, he doubled down on the triumphalism. The left wing has asserted full control of Twitter now, so the right wing will just have to make do with #Gab, #WeSearchr, Breitbart, the House of Representatives, the Senate, the Supreme Court, and the White House. #MAGA Meanwhile Torba is ecstatic. Like Dickinson, hes a pro-Trump Silicon Valley identity whose views and behavior have put him offside with some big players. Before Gab, he founded a social media ad automator. But just last week, he was banned from startup incubator Y Combinator after the organization alleged that he spoke in a threatening, harassing way to other members on Facebook in a succession of discussions where he supported Trump. But on Gab this Tuesday, he was celebrating the services newfound success: Today has been Gabs biggest day yet. Time to upgrade our hosting. :) It could well be that Gab becomes a hang out for the #AltRight if no one else joins the party. In the meantime, since Twitter and Facebook are exercising their version of social engineering via censorship, conservatives may as well congregate where we can at least talk without fear of retribution.

2,"New Ideas In Female Identities: Hijarbie Barbie One woman in Nigeria has some ideas to make Barbie, the iconic Valley Girl of the toy department, morediverse. Haneefah Adam, 24, was studying for her masters degree in England when she came up with the idea of a Barbie doll that reflected HERin a hijab, covered from head to toe. It got me thinking about how Id actually like to see a doll dressed up like I would have covered up, the designer told Mic. In the past week, the Hijarbie has been a hit on Instagram as Adam has posted pictures of her Barbies wearing clothes that she made for them. As a sewing crafts person, the actual craftsmanship of the clothing for Barbie featuring a hijab or an abaya is quite well done. And if Ms. Adam would like to start a business making and marketing hijarbie clothing, thats totally up to her. For people who dress that way, it may well be a big seller. However, Ms. Adam has gone the route so many others of her persuasion have. Shes playing the guilt card, and the diversity smitten media is falling for it, calling her idea and optional clothing for Barbie trendy among other glowing headlines. I want them to be inspired this is about having an alternative and creating an awareness of having toys that adopts your religion and culture and in your own likeness, which at the end of the day, leads to an improvement in self-esteem, Adam told Mic. The goal for Adam is to show young girls who wear hijabs that theyre just as beautiful as their little companion. They become more confident, more driven, they believe more in themselves, which leads to an appreciation of herself and her modest lifestyle and upbringing. Instead of dressing up her dolls in clothes she wouldnt wear, hijabifying it will create a sense of belonging and hopefully make a positive impact, she said. (So far as I know, no good Catholic girl has come up with Barbie in a Habit, or Penguin Barbie complete with nun-chucker and fire coming out of her mouth, so this woman might be onto something. I mean, after all this IS part of my culture, and the nuns are all covered up all the time.) So, no, Mattel is not cranking out a new Barbie variety to go along with the classic, the short, the more round, and what ever else they dreamed up. One woman is wishing for them to reflect her culture without her actually working to make that happen other than providing some prototype clothing. Its just messing with one more icon in western culture whether the doll is realistic or not. Really, come on, hands off the Barbies. ",1
2,"More Moolah Wasted As NIH Kills National Childrens Study After $1.3 Billion Spent No wonder were broke: Congress mandated the National Childrens Study as part of the Childrens Health Act of 2000. The idea was to follow 100,000 newborns across the nation in places ranging from urban California to the Florida swamps until they turned 21, and measure how environmental and other factors affected their health. Yet for the past 14 years, all the NIH managed to do was spend $1.3 billion figuring out how to conduct the massive effort and running some pilot experiments. The actual study wasnt scheduled to start officially until some time next year. According to the Investors Business Daily article, the red flags popped up some time ago, and President George W. Bush wanted to pull the plug on the study throughout his presidency and Congress kept funding it. There were problems with the design of the study, which is still incomplete even after over a decade of work. Now the National Institutes of Health pulled the funding all by itself itself after fourteen years and over $1.3 billion spent on nothing. They found that the study was unsustainable. Probably very true. And very creepy that the government was trying to find a way to follow, track and record personal data on 100,000 people from all over the nation. ",3

2,"UN Threatens Bigoted American Patriots With Judgment Of Them, The Invading People The globalist Arab pirate wears a suit and is not the manly sort that one sees portrayed in movies. When he talks we dont hear the typical arrgghhh that we expect of pirates but thats part of his deceptive method. He disguises himself as a soft-spoken intelligent and refined type who would never be an intent on stealing other peoples countries. His name is Prince Zeid Raad Al Hussein and his far less than impressive title is U.N. Human Rights Commissioner. Excuse us if we dont bother to get up or dont, it really couldnt matter less. Were not impressed by rich Arabs who were educated around by money extorted from the American people and the world through your price gouging oil cartel. Its no coincidence that he just happened to marry the daughter of a consultant to big oil companies, a British geologist named Dr Godfrey Butler. Thats the circle they travel in, filthy rich on our money and over here scolding us for not doing enough with what we have left. We could tell Hussein what to do with himself, which applies some techniques used in geology. The truth is we dont care about your opinion as a representative of the worlds largest criminal syndicate. Your intrusive condescension and lectures are an insult and you need to just shut your hole. Americans dont value your opinion, we will not tolerate your attempts to take over our country, and we dont want to live with either you or your nasty, uncivilized brethren. We Americans are just fine with you Arabs residing in your backward hellholes, we dont need nor do we want your help in turning our country into another one. The arrogant piece of royal UN trash came into our country and criticized our people as being racists and xenophobes. In his remarks Zeid Hussein spoke of the great power of their gathering at defeating the patriots of the world, those who are standing in defense of his Arab aggression. He uses insults as his weapons of choice when attacking Americans and other civilized people opposed to their filthy invasion. He said, We can change this here at the summit together, respect, safety and dignity for all. But not when the defenders of what is good and right are being outflanked in too many countries by race-baiting bigots, who seek to gain or retain power by wielding prejudice and deceit at the expense of those most vulnerable. His comments are spot on if hes taking the unusual position that the UN is attacking the good people of the world through their Islamic invasion, though thats doubtful. The patriots of the world are under attack by the race-baiting bigots of the UN, the Obama regime and the Democrat Party. Nobody is more prejudiced or deceitful than they are. But hes just like the rest of them so hes distorting the truth, and blaming the Americans, as usual. He adds, The bigots and deceivers, in opposing greater responsibility sharing, promote rupture. Youre wrong again, bearded frog prince. The ones invading our country are responsible for the problems. Just go away, we have high standards and you didnt make the cut. A prince from Jordan is nobody compared to any American. Youre not good enough for us and you and your terrorist hordes are not welcome here. Take Obama with you. He threatened to publicly shame those who dont submit to his demands, those who refuse to be bullied by the likes of him and his despicable parasitic UN cronies. He said, Some of them may well be in this hall this morning. If you are here, we say to you: We will continue to name you publicly. You may soon walk away from this hall. But not from the broader judgment of we the people all the worlds people. Not from us. Americans are the original we the people, and were not impressed nor are we intimidated by the likes of this little weasel. The is becoming more direct in their takeover scheming as they realize that their agent on the inside, Hussein Obama, may not be followed up by another similarly anti-American globalist tool. A real American who puts our country first is now the favorite to win in November. When that happens, this asshat can go back to being a nobody inconsequential Jordanian prince that no one cares about. All his high this and high that titles, empty threats and name-calling will mean even less than they do now, when delivered before anempty UN building. Arrggghhh back at you.

2,"Rehana, The Famous Female Kurdish Fighter Responsible for 100 ISIS Deaths, Has Been Beheaded This is the female Kurdish fighter known only as Rehana and reportedly she has killed over one hundred Islamic State militants. The incredible statistic was outlined in a tweet by journalist Pawan Durani and has gathered thousands of retweets since it was posted October 13th. Rehana has killed more than a hundred #ISIS terrorists in #Kobane . RT and make her famous for her bravery pic.twitter.com/YvmfXMpuu1 However, recent reports by various different sources including The International Business Times claim that the heroine has since been captured and executed. ISIS has now gleefully circulated a purported photo of her decapitated body. While this is still yet to be officially confirmed it does appear to be true and no evidence or word has come out that she has survived the battle of Kobani. If true, she will join heralded and remembered much like Kurdish fighter Dilar Gencxemis who blew herself up in an attack the Islamic State outside of Kobani which killed dozens of ISIS fighters. Fundamentalist jihadists fear a woman on the battlefield. They believe if they die in jihad, they will be rewarded with 72 virgins in heaven. If they are killed by a woman however, they are denied their virgins.. Rehana was part of an independent womens battalion of the Peshmerga, or Kurdish militia, who are known for their fearlessness and effectiveness in war.The YPJ is an all-female, independent militia which at the frontline takes up arms alongside the males of the Peoples Protection Units. She was under the command of the famed female soldier Mayssa Abdo, who herself has become famous for running the operation to keep the Syrian border town of Kobani out of the hands of the Islamic State. yea but the Christian bible doesnt instruct to kill in the name of Jihad.The quran teaches to kill all non believers..RIGHT? you guys always have a b.s. line for everything.Lying in the name of allah is perfectly in line with the quran Stop deceiving or people will hate you more. Your Koran teaches you to deceive but people are very much aware of it now. That is why peoples hatred for Obama is growing by leaps and bounds because he has no sense to know he must stop deceiving people. How is stating the truth about Muslims insulting? They were trying to suppress freedom of speech. What part of that dont you understand. They were Christians that lived in Dearborn being stoned. That was at a Muslim fair also. Hey Zack.I am a 71 yr old man who celebrated my 18th Bday, in Morocco. Islam teaches that Jesus was a prophet and will return to tell the world he has converted to Islam. With the Madre(?) Jesus will execute all Christians and Jews. Islam did not become a faith until 700AD and the worship a moon god called Allah. How is this the same ? This is way old news, and not even news as it has been proven to be false information. She escaped,and currently is in Turkey. I love the fact when someone has nothing intelligent to say, they feel the need to correct everyones grammar or spelling. Since when did so many 6th grade teachers get on the comment boards? Dont listen to these mother fuckers, Im agnostic but believe that not all of Islam is bad. What these damn sheeps fail to understand and a see from the big picture, is that those fundamentalist jihadist radicals, want them to hate and therefore, feed the aggression of upcoming warfare, or so thats what these radicalist monsters truly want. Im so fuckin proud that youve stuck up for your belief and stood firm about it. These imbeciles dont know what the hell theyre talking about. Go with peace my friend, turn your attention away from negativity, always!! First off let me educate you. It isnt only isis and other terror groups that do these things in name of their religion its also islamic countries doing this evil. Let me name them for you since your eother ignorant or trying to hide the true nature of islam. Ok here they areiran, saudi arabia, pakistan, palestine, quatar, syria, yemen, egypt when it was run by the muslim brotherhood, several countries in africa, afghanistan, turkey, libya, iraq, uae, etc there are many more. Need i go on, probably not because my point is proven. So open your eyes and admit the truth. Its not just the terrorists following this type of islam its islamic countries doing it too. Hey Samir, Ive got your back, its just that most people havent opened their eyes to the truth that not all people from all religions are bad. Ive gotten to meet many good people from many different religions, it is the retarded ones that take things in there books out of context that make the rest of look bad. For example back a few years ago there was a man that claimed to be Christian that bombed that abortion clinic and he said that he did it in the name of Jesus Christ, not so, normal Christians dont do things like, and just because he did that one thing doesnt make all Christians bad. Lol wth are you talking about? You know how.many lives have been taken in the name of Christianity? Slavery, the ride to America, the Holocaust, Oklahoma City bombing, Black Wall Street, so many lives are uncounted because of skin color, hangings in the south. And countless other occasions. I deployed to Afghanistan 3 Times with the US ARMY, 82ND AIRBORNE DIVISION, 82ND CAB and personally got a chance to get to know many really good afghani people, I ate with talk with them, they are incredibly nice people. Do you know what they told me, when one of their own decides to pick up a weapon and commit an act of violence against another human being, they not only excommunicate them from their village, the family disowns them and they send a messenger around to all of the mosques and let them know not to let that individual into the mosque, so before you open your mouth you really need to do some research on REAL Muslims, and by the way, when you deployed, did you ever get to spend any real time with the people over there because I bet if you did you would have a completely different outlook on them. Sorry more than 270 Million people have been Killed in the name of Islam. Christianity is not even close and that was long ago. Serving your religion has to do with ethnically cleansing the world, fucking little boys, and making women into possessions Youre just a brainwashed Saracen And youre stupid for thinking that theres nothing wrong History tells you, there is something wrong with you Youre acting more like a cunt And not a pussy. Fuckin scrub. If you re classed, youre a chump Maybe we should all just sign up to Scientology? Sure they are a little bit wacko, but at least they all get along. Who/what ever God there is, he must be looking down on us thinking ive created a bunch of dicks im inclined to agree with you samir, i live in central missouri, i raise my own livestock, mainly chickens, and other pultry, i have alot of arab clients that buy eggs and birds for thier comsumption. never has religion ever effected out buisness. none of them have tried to behead me. Overall they are some of the most polite people ive met in along time. overall i agree americans see you and think all your people are terrorist, just not the case Why are you so fucking stupid? Exactly! How many carrots can they grow in that sand? True. What made you reclass? Did you double no go at BCT and so became needs of the Army? (I know what 92W is and it isnt a combat MOS either) Which means you were never an infantryman. (You have to pass OSUT and earn the blue discs and cross rifles to become one) Clearly you never were. you may hate them more but since 911, muslims have been largely quiet about every islamic rampage around the globe until now. silence is sanction pal. you have to examine yourselves whether youre really peaceful or just spineless to speak up. theyre not using Islam to cover up anything, they really believe thats what the Quran is saying. And then they act like were the bad guys. They went to that Arab festival with the sole intention of getting footage of Muslims in a bad light. What they wont show is how they bullied them into responding. They were going to do whatever it took to rile them up. Right now theyre going to say they didnt need to respond violently to us insulting the very fiber of their existence and everything they hold sacred, they couldve just asked us to kindly leave. Ive seen white people get violent over sports. But some Muslims in Detroit of all places get pissed because you showed up to their peaceful festival with a pigs head on a pole, got in our faces, and insulted us and our beloved Prophet, and persisted until you got the reaction you wanted, and that somehow represents 1.6 billion (mostly not even Arabic) Muslims around every continent? Leave us alone, and stop lying. These guys are bullies. If we live in white areas, they spray paint our houses, throw things at us, and yell profanities. They shoot at our Mosques, they harass our kids, and at best they give us dirty looks in public and mumble under their breath. They refuse us jobs that were qualified for and are hiring, they tell us to go home, and even were born and raised here and never been overseas, they make it known that we will never be welcome or accepted here. If we go to a city like Dearborn, where we can be with our own kind and leave them alone (like they want to be), they follow us there and start problems with us there. Read my comment above. Besides, regardless of what happened there, you guys are using a few Muslims who live in Detroit or within spitting distance of Detroit, the shittiest, most ghetto city in America, to represent 1.6 billion people whom the majority arent even Arab at all. I dare you to go to Detroit to an African American parade and hold up signs calling them niggers and telling them to go back to Africa. Check the details of that incident in Dearborn and stop trying to make it sound unprovoked, or the non-Muslims innocent. By hoe down you mean the annual Arab festival where bigots showed up with signs insulting Muslims, the Prophet, and even had a pigs head on a pole? Most likely knowing that these young, American urban youth would get upset and hoping they would get the reaction they did. Thats like showing up to Independence Day parade and burning the American flag, insulting Jesus, and praising 911, and expecting it NOT to get violent. People often fight at protests when the opposition insults them, provokes them, gets in their face. Doesnt matter what the issue is. The fact that you worded in such a way that it sounds as though Muslims just randomly showed up to a Christian gathering and started attacking them goes to show how truly dishonest YOU are. I cant help but wonder if social media did more to get her killed than it helped the her cause. As a Kurd that has been on the ground for the last year doing humanitian efforts, I have to say something. The issue is never with religion. Its people. Religion is not inherintly good or bad. Religion will never save you from anything. The Kurds are 95% Muslims. What has Islam ever done for us? Weve been persecuted by the secular Turkish state, the Shiite Iranian state, the Baathist Iraqi state and the radical ISIS state. Only your own people will save you. Members of your religion will never save you. God doesnt appear to care either. Its individual efforts that make a difference. Not sitting here bashing on others. It doesnt take a genius to tell that Rehana has a rectangular head while the decapitated chick has a round head. Rehana is in Turkey now. Nice try though. lol. Zack, the reason so many of us are so down on muslims is because of what your koran says about how you are to treat the Infidels. Also I grew up in Detroit and that was when Dearborn still belonged to the United States. I guess you havent seen the video of how your brothers treated the Christians that were asking question at the big hoe down there in Dearborn 2 years ago. I understand man. In certain case, those people treat us like animals which eventually at times does more harm than a terrorist. Its true that death is a big issue, but these kind of inhuman activities can hurt you more than your death, as it literally kills you from the inside, whenever you go through that. I understand and agree with you. Like I said, unfortunately, a big number of Muslims have gone astray and even a bigger number of Muslims are supporting those, collectively we call them all terrorist, and we should fight them back to make this world a better place to live. But we should also support the small number of good Muslims left out in this wide world so that they dont start following the wrong path just because of agony suffered from another non-Muslim brother, you see. You are so full of it I can hardly believe it. You would lie through your teeth to put muslims in a good light. There is no good light. I have experienced the muslims in Dearborn. Must be you havent. What about the riots and the stoning of Christians protesting at them? I see you are defending isis again. I am an independent voter. I do lean towards the tea party. They are the only rational choice left for this country after your party had destroyed it. I also do not watch television. I post from personal experience and not from political hearsay. I still have never met, and I meet many people, met a muslim that had any negative things to say about what is being done by islam to this world. Terrorism Is not a pretend thing. It must be fought and defeated. Not lived with as normal. Wyatt48 Look, firstly, I am really sorry that you had to come across such violent people. Hearing that the cops wont do anything is even more sad, looks like they are on bad hands, if what you stated is true. And, about good Muslims, I will tell you what- they have gone extinct in some places whereas in other places they dominate. But its true that the number of Muslims going astray, are on a rapid increase nowadays in our society and also, unfortunately enough, more and more people are trying to USE the religion to whatever makes them happy rather than serving/performing the religion. With all due respect, Zack, we have seen videos of how SOME Muslims in Dearborn, Michigan behave and it isnt pretty. To say ALL Muslims in Dearborn are bad ones is not correct; however, there were many, many Muslims on that video behaving hatefully and like TRASH. Throwing rocks and ugly words at innocent people who happened NOT to be Muslims. I AGREE . IT,S PAST THAT SPREADING (WW3) PERHAPS .WHEN I SEE CANADA INVOLVED IT,S NOT NORMAL OUT THERE. PRAY FOR THE INOCENT FAMILIES, POEPLE THAT ARE STUCK IN THE MIDDLE FOR YEARS .IT HIS NOT ABOUT ANYTHING EXEPT KILL LIKE ZOMBIES HIS THE END NEAR ????? Keep trying. Your anger gives you away. I actually was raised in a Christian household. Lol.. i just know that Islam Christianity is the same thing under God. Christians idiotsidio are just too stupid to realize it You want my addreds to pussy? Lol Lol go ahead call it to see if its my number or not dummy smh stupid pilgrim. Wheres your green card? There on my Facebook pussy. You want to see them add me until then go have sex with your sister pussy (310) 413-9488 another dumb ass nigger that post his phone number on facebook still talking shit with no pictures to prove your this so called combat war hero. do the world a favor and come by my house and pick your mom up. we are all done with her. btw dominique sounds like a queers name. are you a fag? do u suck cock? i think you do suck alot of cock. or just take it in the ass. still no pictures so ya ur full of shit more blah blah from you and no pictures to prove your a so called combat hero. so show us all these so called pictures to prove it. no screen shots of modern warfare either. still waiting for these so called pics u have of you in combat Wow, you are such a puppet of the teahaddists..ISIS is sooooo proud of you right now. That head doesnt look at all like her. Its too big. Unless the guy is short. This is either a fake photo or the head belongs to someone else. Wyatt48. THERE IS NO SHARIA LAW IN DEARBORN MICHIGAN, bro. Stop saying that. I dont get it, in white areas, you guys stare at Muslims when were out in public, whisper under your breath to each other at us, say mean things to us, spray paint our mosques and our houses, shoot at us (sometimes), harass our women, decline us for jobs, refuse to talk to us, or befriend us, ignore us, ask us mean questions, bully us in every sense of the form, then when we decide to live in the same communities together (like Polish, Chinese, black, Jewish, Hispanic, and every other ethnic minority in the U.S. does), and leave you guys alone, you bitch and complain about Dearborn Michigan. You should be happy so many Arabs have decided to settle in that one place, that means thats just ONE place you have to avoid since you obviously cant stand us. Obama is a muslim and is closer to an ISIS member than any of us. Remember he has connections in the Muslim Brotherhood through his brother also. Because he is worthless. MindofGod Not quite true. Social Norms are not all acceptable anymore. Some of the newer ones are pure evil. Sounds like you are one of those internet trolls getting off on acting tough. Keyboard warrior. Probably about 12. Take you bull elsewhere. Like back to your moms basement. That is about your mentality. What a tool you are. Let them burn each other. No, in America we accept the social norms and vilify what isnt. I do not believe you. I hear nothing from the so called Good Muslims. Nothing here in the US is heard from muslims unless their religion doesnt get their way over all others. They take over entire communities and implement their own sharia law. Dearborn, Michigan is a good example. The regular cops will do nothing. The beheaded woman was not Rehana. Rehana has a widows peak; the hairline on the beheaded is a straight line around the face. ISIS are liars. I hope she kills hundreds more and uses pigs blood with each kill. Human Apes?? You mean like Michelle Obama Shes proof that Humans came from apes if I have ever seen it She is just a little slow in the process thats all. Someone please applaud this guy, he is really desperate. Fuck you, bitch. You arent scary. You type really tough fuck-boy, but youre a pussy little faggot. Now, go fuck your mother. Looks like a fake picture, she sent 100 to hell maybe more, just so you know ISIS, God does not honor murderers. God commands not to kill, but you kill innocent women and children. God will have his vengeance with you, you all insult God by saying you are killing in his name. Your religion of so called peace was made up and isnt even real you better ask God for forgiveness and beg for mercy Its funny how killing others is either glorified or vilified depending on who you ally yourself with. I hate ISIS as much as the next person. But killing 1 person does not justify killing another no matter how monstrous they truly are. Dont see many ISIS sympathizers out in the open like ole Envid here. His brothers have lost their honor it seems. Enivid R.N.T.NC/SC 18 hours ago R.I.P Brave lady Obamacare doesnt cover that condition. How old are you? Seriously. I think Dominique is an islamist troll. The diction in his/her posts plus the attack on Christianity gives it away. Lol sounds like you were either a POG or in the Chair force, or Seaman Semen and we heard about you navy boys lol Saying f*** Islam is pure ignorance. Thats whats wrong with America now. We cast out whats socially norm. You showing angry/animosity makes you no better than these terrorist that are killing innocent people. Last time i checked you so called Christians are no better. How many people have Christians killed in the name of Christianity? so if its f*** Islam its f*** Christianity as well.. Your racist comments dont bother me. Its actually quite comical. We all know Where the first Humans are from. We all know that you European recessive gene having, have the bloodline of Neanderthals (Human Apes) go sit in the sun until your skin becomes cancerous. Lil dude And your name is J.T. (Just talk). What does my name have to do with anything? Lol get out of here clown Dude.. your name is Dominique.. Owowowow.. guys take it easy man..! Nothing got to do with religion brother. I am a proud Muslim and I respect every other religion just like my other Christian and Jew friends treat me. damm.. sux.. I would have been glad to fight by her side.. 72 virgins? Its not clear if they are 72 women virgins, just virgins, it could be male virginsthen these jihadists sobs are really fucked lol Stop cruality. Stop barbarism. rejectrepublicanlies with the BIGGEST liar of them all, Obama. Obama is a DUMBOCRAT!! Biggest liar of them all, is Obama. Youre a moron. It sure gave away her position and ISIS aint stupid. EXACTLY my first thought.that journalist got her killed Thats great you have served. I served as well. But dont act like you are John Rambo. You are coming off like an ignorant negroid. Although you wouldnt be the first! F**K ISLAM!!! My first thought was this was photoshopped. I dont believe it either, yet. But, am proud of what she has done. So what are you going to say once Obama is out of office and your crazy conspiracy theories do not come to fruition? That youre a dumbass? Its a psycho-neurological condition known as Obamalalia. They cant help it. Im sure those women arent doing it for the 72 virgins. Theyre just doing what they believe is right. Very honorable. Islam is not the matter in this case. PKK/YPG/YPJ is an terrorist organization, alike ISIS/IS. Now in Kobani, two terrorist groups are killing each other. ISIS/IS is the murderer of about 5,500 people (according to Nytimes), but PKK/YPG/YPJ is slaughtered more than 45,000 innocent people, including innocent newborns, pregnants, children, mothers, and fathers. I recommend you all to check again your knowledge, your belief. There is no good terror. There is no bravery in terrorism. What? Are you an ISISSY sympathizer? I belong to a local club of AR owners. There are 17 of us at last count. We meet twice a week to practice. You may be right. They may get us but before they do we will euthanize dozens of the rabid dogs. As far as killing us on camera, it aint gonna happen hoss. They will never take us alive. We will attack attack attack. They will be forced to kill us in battle. @lynne-forgot your meds I see Horrible shop job That mentality creates terrorists youre fighting fire with fire. everyone will get burned Crude oil does not explode, it just burns! They have been fighting for a thousand years, they used swords when they didnt have guns. So. Care to tell us how life is like being a stupid racist fuck? They would kill you in no time at all. You would never get to your AR-15 and you would be tied up and murdered on camera just like tons of other people. Grow up you arent tough at all if you wanna REALLY fight them then go ahead and do it. would YOU rape someone who took the honor of your brothers? To them she wasnt even worth raping at that point because of how many ISIS members she killed. idk when will George Bush get thrown in jail for helping to commit mass genocide? no religion is correct. Its all bullshit. All religion is bullshit. Yahweh and Lucifer arent real. The bible is evil. Sad that she was killed. But no one would be dead if America didnt meddle in places they dont belong. Go ahead everyone who thinks you need to kill and destroy peoples lives just to keep America thriving. Please attack me because you know that Im right. If we had people who were smart enough to never attack these places in the first place a lot of these heroes would still be alive and well enjoying their days with their families or doing their jobs. If we didnt try to make enemies we would have a lot less enemies. obviously no one on this page understands how governments work? You can get rid of Obama and the same shit will still happen just as these people were trained and armed by former presidentsUSA needs war to survive and it has nothing to do with governments, but more to do with corporations and banks and keeping wars going to keep the almighty dollar flowing. Also this is disgraceful that anyone is playing blame game on a page about a beautiful woman who may or may not have lost her life. the media needs to quit giving these idiots publicity and fame its what they want it gives them immortality they would not have gone had no one seen their posts, videos or pictures and it just drives other egotistical sadistic scum that want fame to commit other horrendous crimes to get their fifteen mins. let us pray for these people that are fighting against evil and risking their lives like Rehana and more you look at grain in the pic of beheading more it looks photo shopped. I personally dont think these men like being shown up by beautiful, strong women p.s. presidents are just puppets they dont make any of the real decisions on anything its the corporations and banks that fund everything that do, sooner we realize this sooner we will realize we dont need governments???? Yeah, especially those Kurd turds. Sounds like justice was served if the tall tales were even half true. So long as whoever killed her (not that any of this is more than fiction anyway) is also honored. You people are not Christians, I take it. You mean like the Kurd turds? Whoa, it got stupid in here reaaaal quick! What fool believes these stories? Same ones that thought Jessica Lynchs story was true. Geez there are a lot of gullible people here. And the doublethink is rich here she was great because she was killing people? But when she was killed (not like any of this is true) that is bad? LOL! This is why democracy cant work people are imbeciles in general. In his mind..a real man to call her a pussy jus one he never had because she would of cut that shit off..you.pusamulaka! they need to execute and behead every muslim cockroach they come across Youre from the FSA? You do believe the Free Syrian Army are Muslims. Instead of verbally bashing one another, how about recognizing this lady who made a huge sacrifice; which lead to her very brutal violent death! She should be honoured celebrated for being a very brave hero! She gave everything she had to make a difference, including her own life! May she RIP! Uhm you live in America, stupid. At least, I dont think weve cut the cord to California yet. Try to understand something: if youre going to take advantage of the privileges, rights, freedoms, and individual ability to prosper in this country, youre going to have to come to terms with its processes. Neanderthal! Monkeys always try to get racist lol. Go back to your cave pussy lmao Lol. Actually i have. I served my country (11B/ then reclassed to 92w) And have pictures to prove it. What did you do to besides keyboard bang? Dont worry i will wait? Being female, there wouldve been nothing but contempt for her in the first place. And for that reason, this ISIS scum wouldve surely raped and tortured her if shed been captured. Instead the image is of what seems to have been where she died, alongside other soldiers. I am sadden by her deathmay she find eternal peace and may God bless her family. let us pray that there are 10000 of her(rehana) that will kill 100 isis each also. then then the world might be safe for a decade or 2. fool Negroid R I P Rehana As regards your knowledge and experience in oil and gas? You are a complete and total moron. Dont try to draw conclusions based on your knowledge of history It simply shines a light on your complete and total ignorance of it at the outset. country made him that way You sound like an internet tough guy with that name calling =) Have you seen real battle? =) this is what muslims do to the world. we must fight against all muslims in the world, now or never, not only to is(is) but all on the world FEMA Camps, Gun Confiscation, Martial Law, etc. You folks are such chicken littles. The sky is falling! What? Do you remember Bush holding hands and kissing the Saudi Prince? By the way, the only flight allowed to leave on 9/12/2001 and was the Bin Ladens back to Saudi Arabia. Do you remember who was President? Ummmmm.thats a complete photoshop! You know that they have guys in their media wing photoshopping and altering pics and stuff right? Ive seen that pic elsewhere, WITHOUT that face! She is with Jesus. God Bless Rehana. They can buy food from other countries. Im sure the Russians, Chinese or Europeans will sell it to them. False, domestic oil production is at an all-time high. Gas prices are decreasing. Do you drive? By the way, the XL Pipelines oil doesnt have to be sold in the US. It can go anywhere in the world. Plus our country would bear the brunt of explosions, spills and ruptures. Why do you folks always bring the President into every single thing? and btw . she was a muslim herself Islam is innocent from these charges . ISIS are not muslims. they are terrorists who call on the cause of building an islamic state. but these acts never had anything to do nor ever will have anything to do with islam Another ISIS member (Ezekiel) right here. Another ISIS member blaming Obama.what the fuck is wrong with you? Where the fuck do you get off saying that about ObamaYOU SOUND JUST LIKE AN ISIS MEMBER! Exactly OBAMA is helping terrorism We truly live in a very pathetic world when an IMAGE of a beheaded human being is posted publicly and the comments below are people taking jabs at each other and arguing over whose right - No one is right in this when the killing stops, the greed subsides, the propaganda, the suffering, and the hatred is replaced with only peace, then the world will be right again. Until then.in the most sarcastic sense: good job to all those who perpetuate this terrible world wide destruction. remember.. we only have one earth. I mean, hopefully one day youll awaken and realize. its all we have. Youre pussy. You never seen combat or been in conflict in your life besidesbesi on the internet Lol and more courage than you will ever have! How is this Obamas fault? You do know this country is ran by major corporations, or are you to dumb naive to figure that out already? Occasionally, reading RWNJ Blogs like this one is so very, very entertaining!! Good Lord, you Obama-hating DOLTS are gullible!! Religion of Peace my A$ S!. I am happy to see Kurds, especially women, take up arms against this goat loving, boy molesting pigs. The bottom line is that if you are a muslim, and you do not speak out against or assist in the fight, you might as well be part of ISBL (Islamic State Boy Lovers) It is time to drop a few MOHABs and be done with this nonsense. You cannot wipe out cockroaches in your home by killing one or two at a time, you must kill them all in a massive attack. Sometimes, it take two or three attempts before you get them all. (ARE YOU LISTENING OBAMA, you muslim terrorist sympathizer?) The Islamic State Boy Lovers are noting more then very dangerous cockroaches. They must also be wiped out. If a few innocent muslims (LOL) are taken out in the process.too darn bad. Sick bastards and cowards every one!!! Sykes picot agreement created ISIS. Know your history Photo Shop Just a guess, but Im thinking RT her photo everywhere might not have been the best idea. R.I.P. Rehana. Obama didnt create ISIS Bush and Blair did when they destabilised the region with an illegal invasion. A woman for all to look up to and admire You are an Ass Hole That makes no sense. You make it seem like no one else in nation supports legislation championed by Obama. You sound like no other politician supports his positions. Thats like saying all we have to do stop an ebola outbreak is cure a single person. Dude, how old are you? Twelve? I cant think of anything coherent to type or rational to say so Ill just plop down some name calling instead -you What? Do you mean this ISNT Obamas fault? Oh thats right, 40 years ago Middle Eastern women wore skirts and went to college. It wasnt until the U.S. decided to fight Communists in the Middle East that more radical religious factions were able to gain footing. But yeah folks, go ahead and blame toddler Obama. Im sure he was totally in on it. Just more workplace violence Nothing to see just move along.. FUCK ISIS fuck off you piss-stained, tiny dicked dribbling adolescent mindless troll. because hes a troll. That is all. You MuSlimes always resort to name calling when you and your phony world domination religion and your pedophile founder are called out by the truth.. Islime is being outed for the completely degenerate organization it really is.. all commenters generalizing muslims, saying nasty things about Islam, please know what whatever religion, race or culture you come from, you have your extremists as well. WE want to eliminate radical extremists who will commit heinous crimes in the name of religion or anything else they can find. Hating something you dont understand will not help solve anything and moreover create further hatred. spoken like a true ignorant. R.I.P REHANA I prefer to believe that she is not dead until it is officially confirmed this is just the sort of propaganda ISIS would want to spread whether true or not Good thing nobody forgot to put all the classy advertisements and popup ads all over article about the brave departed. May she live on as an inspiration for the Kurdish fighters as to what one woman can do to. Dont mourn her, celebrate Rehana as a hero. She had the courage to stand up against evil. Her death will lead the way for more to stand up and fight this growing Islamic evil we see. I am in Canada and our oil industry is huge especially in Alberta. Wow.. She was truly awesome! A woman wiped the floor with ISIS and by killing her they just inspired alot more women to join the fight i bet. Heroic. This is a bullshit story. Photo fake and if she was captured they would put her in a harem My bet is she was already dead..someone just wants to take the credit for beheading her and make a political statement. Her life in defense of her country already said volumes.. Deep condolence, may she rest beside GOD Wow, this is so sad. jesus. why are you such a shitty person. Retard enough said Doesnt look like her to me. The hairline is fairly different. Surely this executioner will one day go to alala land and receive his 72 virgin male goats as promised. Fun will be had by all for eternity. Yeah she did you see it on the pic Are YOU a fucking Kool-Aid sucking Obozorhoid? What do you mean??? Moochelle has more than enough balls and a bigger dick than Barry the Blameles will EVER have. ROFLMAO!!! Its not the media giving that info away its the Muslim-In-Chief doing it. Gitmo his ass ad well ALL be safer! Why wait? Just nuke the worthless goatfuckers now and be done with it? Shut your Obozo-loving Libtard cockhole, bitch! Take your Muzzie pResident and move to Goatfuckistan and make us all happy! That picture is so obviously phony its laughable! If, indeed, those sick goatfuckers managed to kill that brave young lady, I hope the ones who did it get killed by a womanAND SEE IT COMING, knowing in their hearts that they will be going to Hell because a mere woman killed them Frankly, I believe every one of them is going to Hell because they are fighting on the side of Satan himself aka Muhammad the child molester but just knowing that their last moments will be full of absolute terror makes my heart rejoice! The dirty, goatfucking, child-molesting, woman-beating fuckers DESERVE to die slowly, KNOWING that its a woman killing them and believing that they are going to Hell because is a woman killing their worthless Muzzie hides! HEY OBOZO why not send all your faggot buddies in the military over there to fight those bastards? They hate faggots and being killed by a fag might be almost as bad, to them, as being killed by a woman. Plus we get rid of a few fags in the deal. Its a win-win for America! A Very Brave Woman , May She Rest in Peace ! RIP Rehana and prayers to her family. I would not be surprised, either, sandwalker. Its people like Livia with their head in the sand who will be screaming the loudest when the pos potus initiates martial law. I think we should expect that with what the article is about. Dont think anyone of them allowed themselves to be captured. Why do you think that Rehena wasnt captured? Jeremy, did you read the entire article? No one has said women are better fighters than men. If you took the time, and didnt make everything all about you, you would understand that the slime she killed believe that if they die by the hand of a female they will not get their 72 virgins, cant collect $200, and cant pass GO! Consequently, they fear being killed by a woman. Why do morons like you think everything is about you or your manhood? Get a life and perhaps have some respect for people who put their lives on the line for their country/countrymenand even idiots like you. The Vigina in Chief stills thinks ISIS can be negotiated with! Maybe its because secretly Obama supports ISIS and its movement! Looks like she left this world with a smile on her face. So sad that she went the way she did but many thanks for her service! Fifteen years weve been at war with these animals and we havent opened a can of whoop ass yet? WWII was only four years long for us. Why are the manority of these posts about a woman better then most men incredibly offensive to the people/person they are posting about? Its obvious most of you either have put very little thought into what your saying. Or your just horrible ignorant people. The wouldnt be much blood if they re-positioned her after letting her bleed out. This is what the media is good for, that and giving away troop locations and intel. That is the liberal media for you. Oh, please, thats absurd and you dirty this article about a brave Kurdish womens sacrifice for her people with your outlandish tripe. Obama has funded them.. Though military folks are weary of more war, one thing I have noticed from fellow soldiers still serving, they want to fight ISIS head on. Its amazing how these terrorist can get the trash posted and we cant Bomb where they are doing it NSA must only watch Americans, cause bamaboy scared of US not his islamic parasites! They are HIS PEEPS were infidels to his crew! Must REMOVE THE FRAUD DESTROY ISIS ALL ISLAMIC SKANKS! If your dead Rehana mightad ,but a lot ofIS fighters ,sur as hell ill be short a lot of Virgins,wherver they reast in Hell at. OBAMA CONITUNES TO BE FULLY RESPONSIBLE FOR THIS AND THE OTHER ATROCITIES THAT IS ISIS. are you completely insane? to myself I wouldnt be suprised if obama put out a hunting party after her he is ISIS and i would not under estimate the sorry son of a whore Have you seen it?? While doing PEACE sign on her left hand,, her right hands FUCK YOU.. True.. These lady fighters got more courage than any man especially that BRAT OBAMA even in death they couldnt take her smile! fuck you and your evil religion Brief life, but she did her job. Twitter (or whoever) didnt help her by publishing her photo. They think they can kill her spirit and remove the meaning for her existence and cause? They know nothing of the human soul. the picture somehow doesnt look real ; the expression on her face, and I hate to say this but there would be a lot of blood. That looks photoshopped, Rest easy now, Warrior Woman. Your work is done here and youve done much to smite the cowardly evil of Jihadism. The free world is in your debt. God bless you and all brave Kurds. Lmao, true, so true. I agree, she had a very calm look on her face. That should truly scare those sand fleas. You talk as if you think circulating this womans photo and commemorating her success in killing so many people who want to kill us somehow got her killed. Her head was already off when the story of her prowess first showed up a few weeks agoShe was no doubt a brave soldierbut I doubt that she killed 100 IS fighters with her AKArtillery and mortars and truck bombs get high kill numbersindividuals with an AKunlikely Too bad. She was cute. People die in wars, its the harsh truth. Glad to see there are plenty of people, and even females willing to fight. The President himself is checking them out you dont understand. the US EU belong to the house of Islam. they screwed us a long time ago. the more ugly Islam shows, the more resolve freedom fighters gain. We will fight you, Muslims. Moslems believe that if they are killed by a woman, they will not see paradise and 72 virgins. They forget that their prophet mohammad (may pig sh*t be upon him) was poisoned to death by his captive wife after he slaughtered her family. The first one being Obola. Not to mention Balls R.I.P. Rehana! You are a hero! Thank you for what you did and the sacrifice you gave! So very very sad! God bless you and your family! The picture kind of looks like its fake. She was likely shot and killed in the coarse of battle first, then they beheaded her, but they dont want you to know that! Arent you forgetting that Obama is a Muslim too?,and that he is their leader?,hes supposed to be the leader of America,instead,hes the leader of Islam,and in our white house,how wrong can that be?,he should never have been elected in the first place,but he was and need to be impeached,no,he shouldve already have ben impeached a long time ago,we dont need him nor do we want him here,Obama,be gone NOW,do you get the message? Get rid of obama problem solved Why do we still allow any mosques to be built and used in our country? Is anyone infiltrating the mosques to see what they are teaching? THe religion of love and peace anyone checking on them/ That pic looks photoshopped, hopefully she is still alive. Kurds have been begging for our help for HOW long? Not sure at all how Obama sleeps at night; oh, rightforgot, DRUGS. She sent a lot of those bastards on to hell. They paid a price. And there will be no virgins waiting for any of them. America should multiply the price of food to Muslim Nations x 10. Then lets see if they can live off eating their oil? The brave, fearless ISIS goons show what barbarians they are, again. To Hell with ISIS !~ Hey Obama ! Get out of this country !!!! these bastards are sick and brave people like this woman are true heros and our asshole president has no clue of what to do about this whole thing Nuke the perverted slime. Rehana heroine. I would be honoured to meet her in Valhalla. Great work she has done, and a huge pity she did not kill a Million of the cowardly bastards. That said her co-fighters can only be influenced by her great deeds, and will carry on in their endeavours to eradicate and expunge this Black-Plague from the face of the Earth! R.I.P. Rehana I think she is still alive. The photo looks like poorly done photoshop You reckon, that Rehanna was Muslim, too? Dumb ass MuSlimes should realize there are no virgins waiting for them, if there ever were any, the pedophile Moehamud has had his way with them.. its bs we have more oil then they do, thats why presbarry ebolma wont allow drilling that not her look at the good and you see it not her any one can see that not her the end So looking at her head. She died with a smile on her face? I dont believe this propaganda one bit. Agree. I wish these rabid dogs would have the audacity to march on the streets of my town. My AR-15 needs a workout. :-) Here muzzie muzzie muzzie, here muzzie muzzie, muzzie. i want to kill all muslim priests, all muslim priests should be able to shit around only without heads Beauty Among the Beasts,..! Obama who preaches to us every day that the Republicans are waging the war on women is a coward who will not even make an attempt at blowing the killers back into the caves where they belong Im glad its finally getting out there. 0bamy supports these terrorist. When will the world wake up and try him for his involvement in mass genocide. . Next time some woman fighter kills a lot of ISIS, it might be best not to announce it and show her name and picture on the Internet. It might not be safe for her. If its true, she died for a just cause. Of getting rid of ISIS. You were braver than many men Rehena, including those who killed you. Wow, could you warn us a bit before the graphic photos show up? If the US had a REAL leaderwith testicles and couragethese scumbags would have been destroyed by now. We dont need Saudi oil, true. But we DO need control of it. By negotiating and purchasing the oil we prevent China, et al, from acquiring it at even cheaper rates. This really saddens me. she had courage and braveryshe fought like a warriorGod Bless her soulThank you Rehana Yes! I totally agree!!!! Rest in peace dear Rehana!!!! The savages of Islam will stand before the judgement of God,just like everyone else. They will then discover that they are being led astray by a false, perverted teaching. bravest heroin! I salute you! The US and Canada have more than enough natural gas and oil to put the Saudis out of business, but environmental activists prevent the full exploitation of these resources. Thank you Rehana for your bravery and willingness to both kill and be Rest in peace rehana. We have way more oil in the ground than Saudi Arabia. Thats a much faster and practical answer. Obama wants us beholding to the middle east. The environmentalist movement was kidnapped by the extreme left decades ago. Design a car that does not run on oil and they will have no money. Stop giving anyone in the Middle East weapons and they cannot fight. If we still have this problem five years after we do these two things drop a couple of nukes on them. Problem solved. RIP brave soul, may you soar with the angles. Looking at the expression on her face she was at peace and in the hand of God. I would hope any other female Peshmerga would not allow themselves to be captured. But from the looks of the image, that female wasnt captured but found dead. I hate those bastards! Rehana, had more backbone and courage than Obama will ever have! ",3
2,"Net Neutrality: Obama Administration Wins In Court In a decision being both cheered and decried by internet users everywhere, in a 2-1 vote, theU.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit upheld the Obama Administrations order for the Federal Communications Commission to enforce net neutrality and not allow ISPs and the providers of broadband to pro-rate costs according to what internet users consume. Essentially, the FCC declared the internet a utility last year when it was decided to uphold net neutrality, and is claiming victory with this ruling: The net neutrality order, passed over a year ago, isFCC Chairman Tom Wheelers signature move during awhirlwind time as head of the commission. Todays ruling is a victory for consumers and innovators who deserve unfettered access to the entire Web, and it ensures the Internet remains a platform for unparalleled innovation, free expression and economic growth, Wheeler said in a statement issued shortly after the ruling. After a decade of debate and legal battles, todays ruling affirms the Commissions ability to enforce the strongest possible internet protectionsboth on fixed and mobile networksthat will ensure the internet remains open, now and in the future. The internet providers filed suit against the FCCs ruling on Net Neutrality on first amendment grounds, claiming that mobile broadband was a new service that should not be subject to the 1996 Telecommunications Act, and that the internet itself is not really a utility, arguments that two members of the Circuit Court panel, both Democrat appointees, rejected: The dissent in this case discussed the internet and broadband availability and access as more of a natural monopoly than a utility and questioned the FCCs oversight. Defeating net neutralityhas long been an objective of Comcast, ATT, Verizon, and other bundled internet and cable providers who seek to charge more for using services that use a tremendous amount of broadband, like streaming Netflix, that they say hogs broadband and slows down services to other customers. However, Comcast has admitted that this has been a scheme to keep some revenue streamsprofitable as there would be a discount for using one sort of service or another. Courtesy of Freeper Cyberman: Comcast Admits Broadband Usage Caps Are A Cash Grab, Not An Engineering Necessity For years the broadband industry tried to claim that they were imposing usage caps because of network congestion. In reality theyve long lusted after usage caps for two simple reasons: they allow ISPs to charge more money for the same product, and they help cushion traditional TV revenues from the ongoing assault from Internet video. Comcast is of course slowly but surely expanding usage caps into its least competitive markets. More recently the company has tried to deny it even has caps, instead insisting these limits are data thresholds or flexible data consumption plans. But when asked last week why Comcasts caps in these markets remain so low in proportion to rising Comcast speeds (and prices), Comcast engineer and vice president of Internet services Jason Livingood candidly admitted on Twitter that the decision to impose caps was a business one, not one dictated by network engineering. This admission and stance makes the argument against net neutrality look like a matter of greed rather than business necessity, and to some who believe in equal access, pro-rating services might appear to be a barrier to entry. However, industry insiders have long argued against net neutrality on the very same grounds which the FCC celebrates it. From the Associated Press: And the government having a blank check to regulate a communications tool in the United States should be a non-starter, constitutionally speaking. Forget the pro-rated services that really are a privilege of private enterprise. Telecom industry giants pledge to appeal the ruling, which was always expected to reach the Supreme Court, and are also calling for Congress to change the rules regarding the internet, as in the 20 years since the Telecommunications Act was passed into law (thank you Senator John McCain) the landscape of electronic communications has changed.

2,"New Actual Science Poking Holes In Climate Change-Global Warming Theory Who the heck said science on climate change was settled? Who ever it was needs to have their scientific credentials revoked. It looks like a whole lot of terrestrial and maritime details got left out of the darn computer models mainly because the actual people setting themup didnt know they existed. A team of top-level atmospheric chemistry boffins from France and Germany say they have identified a new process by which vast amounts of volatile organic compounds (VOCs) are emitted into the atmosphere from the sea a process which was unknown until now, meaning that existing climate models do not take account of it. The effect of VOCs in the air is to cool the climate down, and thus climate models used today predict more warming than can actually be expected Though the cooling effects of isoprene are well known, what is new is the discovery that the oceans are producing much more of it than has been accounted for in the alarmists climate models. Here is more evidence of what we have known for some time: that climate models simply do not mirror the reality of a [complex] system and that they should never have been trusted in the first place, says Dr Benny Peiser, director of the Global Warming Policy Foundation.James Delingpole, Breitbart London, 1 October 2015 So, the worlds leaders are headed to Paris soon to hammer out a climate treaty for a problem that most likely does not exist considering that there has been zero warming of the planet since 1988 and none of the predictions made about what would happen when man-made global warming got on a roll have come true. Hey, yall, dont let little things like new scientific discoveries about a planet that is billions of years old and has a heating and cooling system that would make Ben Franklin and Willis Carrier drool stop you from destroying economies all over the world just because some climate scientists wrote computer programs full of holes and claimed the sky is falling. So how does this system featured in the new system really work? In essence, the new research shows that a key VOC, isoprene, is not only produced by living organisms (for instance plants and trees on land and plankton in the sea) as had previously been assumed. It is also produced in the microlayer at the top of the ocean by the action of sunlight on floating chemicals no life being necessary. And it is produced in this way in very large amounts. We were able for the first time to trace back the production of this important aerosol precursor to abiotic sources. So far global calculations consider only biological sources, explains Dr Christian George from French lab the Institute of Catalysis and Environment, in Lyon. VOCs such as isoprene are known to be a powerful factor in the climate, as they cause the formation of aerosol particles. Some kinds of aerosol, for instance black soot, warm the world up: but the ones resulting from VOCs actually cool it down substantially by acting as nuclei for the formation of clouds. It has previously been suggested that production of VOCs by pine forests could be a negative feedback so powerful that it limits climate change from reaching such levels that it could become really a problem in the world. With the discovery of the new abiotic sea process, the idea that cutting carbon emissions may not be all that urgent is looking stronger. Thats probably good news, as it has emerged lately that efforts to cut carbon emissions to date are having the unfortunate side effect of poisoning us all. Science on the level this study from France and Germany exhibits was not really possible before now. Why is it we would close the field of study based on information that is years old? Would it be so that said information would not be challenged? Considering that the oceans cover over two thirds of the earths surface, this is HUGE news, and may well contribute to the solar part of the equation when it comes to regulating the earths temperature. But the larger question on the science itself remains, and in this case, it must be asked what would Einstein do? Hed most likely keep his options open. The earth is full of surprises. The climate change community just got one, and it doesnt help their cause. Look for this to get buried. ",3
2,"Defending Liberty We exist in a vast sea of ignorance and lack of understanding in regards to history, politics, and ideology. Not to mention the implications of each upon our nation and civilization. Perhaps we should not be surprised that large segments of society cant put the Civil War in the correct century or begin to find major countries on a map. There are entire political ideologies that rely on that mind-numbing, and sometimes frightening, misunderstanding and basic ignorance that a significant portion of society manifests as a source for their power and strength. I find liberalism/progressivism to be little more than a mental poison, an ideological and philosophical cancer on society, that is malicious and destructive to everything that it touches from the sanctity of human life, to the traditional family structure (the basic foundation of all civilization), to national security, to free enterprise and beyond. It is the bane of Western Civilization, the concept of personal liberty, and a threat to all I hold dear. And it too often shares the mentality (and dare I say even goals?) of some of the nastiest political philosophies that have ever marred the face of the planet. It must be opposed however and whenever it can. I dont live in an ideological vacuum, instead I actively have an ideology and world view. Liberalism is a dangerous, vicious, corrupting and deceptive ideology that hates everything I believe to be true, right and correct. It is as much a religion or mental defect as a political philosophy and I will fight it however, whenever and wherever I can. Im proud to be on the front line in the culture and ideological wars for the heart and soul of this nation. No apologies are offered. We are now engaged in a great struggle for the heart, soul, and future of a nation, a great people, and perhaps even Western Civilization itself. Progressivism destroys everything that is good and just and wages unrelenting war on everything I believe to be sacred, right, and true. They have no pity and are not constrained by the mores of tradition, values, honesty, or rule of law. They dismantle free enterprise, flood our nation with foreign immigrants both legal and illegal, dismantle and redefine the family, mock our traditions, slaughter the unborn, ignore our history, mock Christianity, and shred morals and values at every turn. There are not two equally valid ideologies to choose from. All paths do not lead to truth. The road to serfdom is a path we would rather not take, and warning people what can eventually happen when you give up liberty, control, and decision-making to a monolithic, increasingly powerful, and rapidly growing government that seeks to dictate, regulate, or control nearly every aspect of your personal, business, and daily life is not paranoia, but reality. The face of modern fascism is far more deceitful in the modern age. Progressivism is fascism with a compassionate face. Perhaps I take a larger view of the struggle. People who are out to destroy everything I believe in and undermine the traditions, culture, language and institutions of Western Civilization certainly are an enemy, at least the ideology they believe in is. Have you been paying attention? Are you aware of the agendas being enacted and the ones that are planned? Statism is alive and well my friend, and liberty and freedom are on life support. The corrupt cabal who rule us now would have kissed the feet of King George and embraced his tyranny for the sake of the common good. To the brave founders of this nation liberty was not just some obscure concept to give lip service to, but something worth fighting and dying for. It was real. We have lost that as a society and we must be willing to do what is necessaryto regain it. Liberty is worth sacrificing everything for. It is at the core of what makes us free men. The threat we face is not a fantasy, but a reality that is growing everyday. Defending the Founders vision and the Republic they created with vigor and even their own words and passion is a great thing, not something to be avoided. We are defending their vision and their dream. We are the heirs to their gift and it deserves to be defended every way possible. They earned it and they deserve it. The era of decorum and polite political discourse is no longer with us and has been moldering in the grave for some time. That bridge has not only been crossed (by both sides) but has been burned down behind us. Righteous anger and indignation is a fire that should be stoked, not extinguished. Even Christ drove the money changers out of the temple. There is no shame in that but we all must do what we can to defeat the ideological barbarians in our midst. If the Founders saw the state of the country they would be aghast at what we have allowed to happen to their bold experiment. Conservatives (at least a good many) see themselves as the spiritual descendants of the Founding Fathers and the keeper of the flame of freedom handed down to us from them. What we see now is a protest characterized not by a roar for revolution, but by a call for restoration repair of our Constitutions authority and return to its standard for Rule of Law. Honor, justice, and humanity, forbid us tamely to surrender that freedom which we received from our gallant ancestors, and which our innocent posterity have a right to receive from us. We cannot endure the infamy and guilt of resigning succeeding generations to that wretchedness which inevitably awaits them if we basely entail hereditary bondage on them. Thomas Jefferson It is interesting to see some factions of the Right not embracing guerrilla conservatism. The Left firmly trampled to death the last rules of civility and the argument of we need to be nice, because if we arent they might be mean to the next Republican president is bologna (ask President Bush about that). If you show up to a gun fight with cardboard swords you are going to lose. I advocate ideological warfare and an energized, confrontational conservative movement. The Left is completely dominating in every arena and it is not by playing nice. There are some who wring their hands about civility and propriety while the shining city on the hill is being looted and pillaged by the barbarian followers of an evil ideology. Let me know how playing nice works out. The rest of us will be in the trenches fighting the good fight. Beautifully expressed, and on the whole, something I can embrace However, if I may made a couple observations First of all, it would be more appropriate perhaps to have used say a picture of the Liberty Bell, battle at Waterloo, or breaking free of shackles for your article representing LIBERTY, rather than a depiction of this graphic depiction of one of the most notorious of the sncient pagan dieties Liberty, aka: Isis, Semiramis, Helen, Diana, Columbia, Queen of Heaven, Mother (of God) Mary, Queen of Babylon, Ishtar, Aphrodite, Venus, Minerva, Allah, Gaea, Madonna. And so on The wife of Nimrod, wife/mother of Osiris/Horus, etc She as the iconic figure of Goddess worship, symbolizes the Anti-Christ system, which is the exact root or nature of the evil you are condemning!! Just sayin Secondly, although the general concept of Liberty seems to be a good thing and we all desire and deserve personal freedom, I believe we might have misinterpreted the concepts of Liberty as they have been applied and how they have in fact been used to enslave us. Our founding fathers (or most of them) were part of a group mentality, fraternal order that neither offered, respected nor tolerated any form of autonomy or real individualism. Though much of their real goals and ideologies were kept hidden at the time, we mow know the influence of Freemasonry on this country, so it is important to reexamine our traditions and from whence they came. I will leave that to each of you to do on ypur own, as you should The bottom line is that there is No True Liberty to be found in the traditions of men!!! Even extreme patriotism is a next door neighbor to Statism! IF the majority of the people of the United States are still Believers in the Most High God, and His Son, Yeshua we will begin to understand that this is all a LIE, designed (not by Progressives, Dems, nor Communists, etc) by the TRUE ENEMY of mankind Every single political system in history, beginning in Sumer Has been purposefully created and manipulated to draw us away from God and REAL freedom, the kind only found in service and obedience to Him!! So, we ALL need to STOP ALL the blaming and hating, bickering and fighting between ourselves And see that the kind of deviseness being perpetrated all over the world is what will cause us to fall. Humanity ceases to exist when we abandon our truest purpose which is Love and absolute obedience to He who created us ONLY! This is not about religion, which does exactly the same thing as tradition, patriotism, collectivism, etc does This is strictly a PERSONAL and SPIRITUAL thing! ",3
2,"ALL NEW VOTER POLL: Biggest Problem In American Politics Is NOT Big Money, It Is...... Rasmussen will poll just about anything for a headline. Every now and then they do a poll that may actually shock the pundits, and this week, their poll just might. In a national telephone survey of 1,000 during the second week of February voters, Rasmussen found that: Which of these is the biggest problem, though? (Drumroll, please.) So, reading between the tea leaves here, it looks like the American people are not quite as lulled to sleep as the mainstream media would like. The people have come to the conclusion that dun dun DUN there is such a thing as media bias. Just exactly what that entails or which way the media is supposed to swing is not made clear, but the bottom line is as much all the money in politics is decried, the actual voters would appreciate unbiased and straight up reporting. As for the differences among people who claim allegiance to one of the two main political parties: Republicans show slightly less concern about the influence of wealthy individuals and special interests on elections compared to Democrats and voters not affiliated with either party. GOP and unaffiliated voters are more critical of wealthy special interests, though, than they are of wealthy individuals and companies. Democrats are less likely than the others to believe the media have too much influence over elections. When asked to choose between the two, Republicans name media bias as a bigger problem than large campaign contributions by a 67% to 28% margin. Democrats see big money as the bigger problem 57% to 34%. Among unaffiliated voters, 50% say big campaign contributions, while 40% say media bias. H/T Washington Examiner ",3
2,"[Watch] Hunt and Shaffer Offer Their Recommendations for American Action in Iraq Bill OReilly accurately describes Iraqs government as a corrupt mess, and points out that there is no reason for us to be defending the Baghdad government. He defines that as a separate issue from defending ourselves. He plays a clip in which a military spokesperson acknowledges that the American air strikes to date have disrupted ISIS encroachment on Irbil, but will have no long-term strategic impact. Lt. Col Tony Shaffer agrees that there is a temporary, local benefit, only. He says we should be talking about victory and defeat and the way you do that is with overwhelming force. He thinks the Kurds are up to the job of being the boots on the ground in this conflict in conjunction with air power provided by the United States. Col David Hunt has a different take on things in that he doesnt believe that bombing works, reminding the audience that weve been bombing Iraq for twenty-five years under four different presidents and in his opinion it hasnt worked. He says we should be using cruise missiles and drones, as well as humanitarian relief. He also agrees that the Peshmerga are a very capable fighting force and that a partnership of the type that Col Shaffer suggested makes sense. Many military experts have offered a similar view on the best way to pursue a solution to this crisis in Iraq. We can only hope that our some sane minds in the White House are watching and listening as well.

2,"[Listen] Survival Expert James Wesley Rawles on a Grid Down Electric, Other Emergencies What type of a world would Americans encounter if our power grid were to collapse? Where would you want to be to have the best odds of survival for yourself and your family? James Wesley Rawles discusses what could happen in an interview on The Watchmen.fm. He says much of the questions about survivability naturally will be determined by the nature of the disaster, but a situation in which the power grid is lost would be among the most catastrophic. A loss of electric capacity could lead to an estimated 90% death rate among the population of the United States. Virtually every public health system, from water to sewage to food and medicine, is directly dependent upon a fully functioning electrical supply. He also says that if the grid does go down, you dont want to be in a town of any greater size than about 500 people. Anything larger than that and the sense of community would be lost, resulting in an every man for himself type of attitude. The interview is from 2010, but its even more relevant now than when it was first broadcast.

2,"More NFL Ratings Come In: League And Sports Writers In Denial (Put Some Ice On It) We the People came to understand that one of the reasons Hillary Clintons team wanted the first presidential debate on a Monday night was to go up against Monday Night Football. That way, the logic went, fans of the NFL would be diverted. Wellaccording to the Neilsen ratings out today, 81 million people tuned into the debate Hillary blinked her way through, and Monday Night Football Atlanta Falcons and New Orleans Saints only attracted a 5.7 rating which is 38% BELOW the same time frame in 2015. (The American people really wanted to see what Hillary health scare would pop up this week, but no one in control wants to admit that.) Monday night then, logically, the drop COULD be explained by the interest in the debate. Maybe. But that doesnt explain the rest of the ratings numbers for the last three weeks. Week 1 was covered in this space previously. (Article with graphics here.) The numbers were bad. Now, theyre worse. Sports Business Daily reported Monday that the overnight ratings forSunday Night Football between the Dallas Cowboys and Chicago Bears drew 18.62 million viewers and scored a 12.9 in the Neilsen ratings, which is down from 13.7 in Week 2 and 13.9 in Week 3 a year ago. Elsewhere, the early-afternoon regional slate of games on CBS dropped by 18 percent compared to Week 3 last season while FOXs 4:25 p.m. game between the Pittsburgh Steelers and Philadelphia Eagles (which saw Philly win in a surprisingly one-sided affair) dropped by 1 percent from the same time slot last season. The lone bright spot was FOXs early-afternoon slot, which went up by about 3 percent. Putting that in another form: According to almost all analysis, and comments, the reason this is the case can be summed up in two words: Roger Goodell. The analyst quoted above believes the drop is due to an inferior product on the field, and does not take the boycott movement too seriously as possibly being the reason for the drop in ratings. The commenters, on the other hand, do take it seriously. For many, Colin Kaepernick not being disciplined following his temper tantrum was the last straw. The NFL is not known as the National Felons League for nothing. In addition, the league office has consistently sided with progressivism in the face of a socially traditional fan base. Many Americans are no longer subscribing to cable even if almost all sports are now broadcast on cable networks. People who know football claim that the play is nowhere as good as it used to be. The showboating and displays to garner attention have done nothing but escalate in a country that shuns self-promotion. It was only a matter of time before something like Colin Kaepernick refusing to stand for the national anthem happened. When Goodell and the league did nothing as a whole to reprimand himthat was the end. Now, the ratings are falling, and the NFL has no one to blame but itself. If that means Roger Goodell is the problem, the OWNERS of the franchises are on the hook for letting him stay in the job. ",1
2,"EPA Pays To Develop Tool To Monitor Shower Duration Times At Hotels If the Environmental Protection Agency keeps this crap up, we Americans wont have any privacy left at all. This week, not only do the busybodies in the federal governments Peoples-Rights-Stripping Agency want to limit carbon emissions from grills, but now they want to know how long hotel guests spend in the shower. The agency is spending $15,000 to create a wireless system that will track how much water a hotel guest uses to get them to modify their behavior. Hotels consume a significant amount of water in the U.S. and around the world, an EPA grant to the University of Tulsa reads. Most hotels do not monitor individual guest water usage and as a result, millions of gallons of potable water are wasted every year by hotel guests. The proposed work aims to develop a novel low cost wireless device for monitoring water use from hotel guest room showers, it said. This device will be designed to fit most new and existing hotel shower fixtures and will wirelessly transmit hotel guest water usage data to a central hotel accounting system. Lets see if we have this straight: the government via the Environmental Protection Agency with a grant to a know it all at the University of Tulsa wants people staying in hotels to shorten their showers (because people who arent seeing the bill for how much water they use are bound to use more), so, they are developing a wireless device to attach to shower heads which are already low flow, you know that will send data on the number of gallons used in any room to the billing software for the hotel, so that they can bill the guest for the wasted water used while bathing. This is supposed to modify behavior by the purse, one supposes. As if we were tourists staying at Walters Alps Chalet, or where ever it was, where five minutes of hot water cost five Swiss Francs. Not kidding. Elizabeth Harrington of the Washington Free Beacon does not say if the hotel industry asked for this device nor how they calculate hot water costs per guest, but she does tell us what the EPAs grant seekers recommendations for shower times are: [Tyler W. Johannes, Ph.D., an associate professor in the University of Tulsas School of Chemical Engineering who is working on the project] and his team assumed the average hotel shower lasts 8.2 minutes, using 17.2 gallons of water per guest per shower. Initially our device/app seeks to get hotel guests to reduce their water use by 10 percent or to reduce their showers by about one minute, he said. Johannes provided a link to Home Water Works, which recommends taking a five minute shower to reduce water use. The website, which is a project of the Alliance for Water Efficiency, also suggests watering plants with discarded cold water from showers that take a long time to heat up, and taking navy showers. The method requires three steps: 1) turn on water to rinse body and hair; 2) turn off water while shampooing hair and washing body with soap and washcloth; 3) resume water flow and rinse off all shampoo and soap, the group said. Using this technique, the total duration of water flow can easily be reduced to 5 minutes or less. So, for those of us with sinus and lung issues that are helped by steam showers of ten minutes or longer, are doctors notes going to be needed to leave the hot water running while we shampoo hair, rinse (with long hair this takes a while), condition hair, pin it up so that the conditioner can sit for the requisite 3-5 minutes while we wash some parts and then use an exfoliating sea salt scrub on the rest? And then theres shavingeveryone does different parts. Seriously, though, for us ladies with long locksare we going to be penalized for the amount of water it takes to get the conditioner rinsed out? Or even for using conditioner? Has this guy ever spent time in the shower during an American winter? Its the one time of the day, some of us actually get warm. According to the breast cancer people, once a month women should feel themselves up in the shower to find any potential lumps or bumps. That can take a while. Guysdont go there. And then for those who are athletes of all varieties a hot shower helps loosen cramped muscles. Yes, it takes forever sometimes for the water to heat up. Its far more water than is needed to water plants. It doesnt take a rocket scientist to imagine the leaps the EPA is going to take with this one. As Jazz Shaw says of the water conservation issue, yes there are parts of the country where water is scarce and, because of current EPA priorities, needs to be conserved. However, out here where clean and potable water actually is massively cleaned up Mississippi River water, or in coastal areas were its desalinated, the whole water conservation argument is really not applicable, especially for hotel guests. So, EPA, get out of my shower. Thanks to you, it is one of the few places any of us have any privacy any more. If we pay for the water, who cares how much we use. ",4
2,"Hooters And Islam...ClashDaily Stirring The Pot This morning, a very pertinent question popped up into the old Facebook News Feed from ClashDaily. This particular question was multiple choice and came with the following story to boost the scenario to be presented. QUESTION: Should Hooters Shut Down Because Theyre Offensive to Islam? After a quick internet search on Bing (avoiding Google due to the rigged search algorithms), so far, Islamists havent said much about Hooters, the American chain of sports bars where the waitresses are chosen via cup size (this writer qualifies, actually). However, given the account from Belgium above and the way that Islamists prefer to guilt native populations into giving them their way, its only a matter of time before some girl following Islam applies for a job at your neighborhood Hooters, and complains because the uniform is, shall we say, too skimpy. Or objects to the heavenly aroma of baconor of the alcohol being servedor all of the sports on the flat screens that are a waste of timeor take your pick. As it is, there are a whole lot of people here in the United States arent all that wild about Hooters in general since the idea isnt so much that its about the food, but the scenery. Even western standards of decency are stretched with the Hooters chain concept. If one wants to go to a sports bar, there are plenty of other options, and some even have better chicken wings. No, what ClashDaily is somewhat prepping the population to expect is the request to suppress American culture from Islamists starting with low hanging fruit. (Pun not intended, just a happy accident.) Back in July, one Imam in Britain made some fairly bold claims about what would be eliminated from American culture once Islam took over. (The full list and commentary is here.) Everything that makes Hooters Hooters is on that list. So, naturally, red blooded Americans like those populating the staff at Clash Daily, are looking around to see what in American culture could be a target for Islamists given that in Europe one woman refusing to wear a headscarf led to a riot. Be warned. Hooters may well be a symbolic beginning. ",3
2,"Roger Stone Organizing Cleveland Protests To Stop Election From Being Stolen By GOP Elites Trump insider Roger Stone realizes the serious nature of the threat faced by all Americans as we are having our rights as Americans to free and open elections challenged and undermined by the sleazy, corrupt political establishment. Stone says, If I have any advice for Trump supporters, rank and file Trump supporters it would be this: Go to Cleveland, come to Cleveland. Dont let the big steal go forward without massive protests; peaceful, non-violent, massive protests. He continues, So as they used to say, dont wait for orders from headquarters, ride to the sound of the guns. I dont mean to imply violence in that, I mean ride to where the action will be. We have to let the Republican bosses and the kingmakers and the insiders, and the lobbyists, know that were not going to stand for the big steal. So if you are a Trump supporter, he says, Make plans now. Take a bus, hitchhike, carpool; take a train, fly if you can afford it, we need you in Cleveland. Alex Jones calls it, The most political direct action, the most important action in decades, if not in a hundred years, folks. And bottom line, we can talk about his right, you are going to plan to lead, with myself and many others, demonstrations, events, movements, the details wont be out for a while, but folks, be in Cleveland for the week of that convention. Be there and we are absolutely going to show the world the real power. Jones says, We need five million constitutional Trumpians, Trumpists, to be there so that all the Soros trash and all the filth, the few hundred thousand theyll have there, are totally dwarfed and the establishment does not dare steal the popular vote from the people. And so were going to have more information very, very soon, people can go to the stop the steal website of Roger Stone and get ready.

2,"Worlds Biggest Mystery.. May Have Been Discovered...[Watch] Every single piece fits. Now, of course, we have to go through the whole archeological process, and we plan to do that within the next few months, but I feel very confident that weve discovered the site, he told CNN. This is the ship that changed the course of human history, Clifford said. If the claim is confirmed, it would go down as one of the most significant underwater archaeological discoveries ever. It is the Mount Everest of shipwrecks for me, said Clifford, 68. But it isnt a new find for him. Cliffords announcement involves a wreck he and his team investigated in 2003. A cannon was found as part of the wreck. But, Clifford told CNN, archaeologists at the time misdiagnosed the cannon. The ship still has attributes that warrant an excavation to determine the sites identity, archaeologist Charles Beeker of Indiana University said Tuesday. Barry may have finally discovered the 1492 Santa Maria. The evidence, Beeker said, is very compelling. ",1
2,"Easy Way to Make 200 Grand A Year This is no joke, if you would love to make $200,000 a year and have some fun doing it, you could try the Cosplay scene at the comic book and science fiction conventions. Several times a year, scores of attractive women and some men, make their way to various Conventions around the U.S. and abroad.Just last week Comic Con in California was the target market for these vixens of the Dime novel. Once there, they don skimpy cosplay outfits to entertain the conventions superhero fans. Many do it just for fun, but for some its a job that pays well into the six figures. In addition to a per diem and travel costs, popular professionalcos-playerscan make at least $5,000 to $10,000 a show,comic book expert Christian Beranek said. If you add in mail order sales, crowd funding contributions and YouTube ad revenue, the top talents are pulling in close to $200,000 a year. Of course it helps if you happen to be attractive and young, but neither is a necessary requirement. A good body image and nice personality go a long way with the crowds. Take Boy Meets World actress Maitland Ward, who has become one of the most popular cosplay stars. She said a Star Wars themed photo shoot she did in 2015 got the ball rolling. It actually started when a few photographers who covered me and my daring red carpet looks thought it would be a cool idea if I became the girl that posed in Star Wars gear for the holiday and annual Star Wars celebration, May the Fourth Be with You, she said. I thought it was a cool idea to shoot as slave Leia, and didnt give it much thought. It was only after the photos came out did I realize how much fans enjoyed seeing me dressed up. Ward wont say just how much she made for her appearances, but said theres plenty of money changing hands at the conventions. Ive seen cosplayers charge $20 to $30 for selfies, and they charge just as much for their autograph. I could never do that, Ward said. A lot of the desirability of a character is in the costume. They should be sexy but true to the character you are portraying. For instance, you would not find Cat Woman running around wearing a red Jessica Rabbit cocktail dress. And if youre a guy, you wont be a big draw if you are paying tribute to a Star Wars Sand Person. Ginny McQueen has been dressing up in character costumes since 1998. Her website features a hire me section as well as a support section that allows fans to donate money to her projects, including cosplay, but McQueen said she does it because she loves it. While I have received many opportunities over the years because of cosplay, it is still first and foremost a hobby for me, said McQueen. Ward agreed telling interviewers, if you dont like it, you wont last long. The key to having longevity as a cosplayer is first you have to enjoy it, because most days you are on your feet all day, the costumes arent that comfortable, and the shoes have to match the outfit, said the 39 year old. So if you are in it to make money, you will burn out fast. But some critics say the original intention of celebrating comic book art, shows, and movies at the conventions has been tainted by cosplayers looking to cash in on their looks. Some Comic-Coners probably dont appreciate the half-naked women in body paint and sexy costumes gathering crowds, said Bill Swift, editor of Egotastic.com, a site that features many of the popular Cosplay women. But as is the case of half-naked women in body paint and sexy costumes, the majority of fanboys are well in favor. Swift added that while not all women who dress up as Leia or Lara Croft are genuine fangirls, they work hard for what they earn. The popular ones communicate with the nerd fan base 365 days a year on social media, he said. So its not as if they just show up to Comic-Con and suddenly have cred. Nope, it is like everything else in life, if youre going too succeeded, you have to work at your trade, and good looks will only get you so far. Fox News contributed to this story. 2016 R. L.

2,"New Whistleblower Leak Exposes Classified Details Of Obamas Drone Use The leaker, or whistleblower as The Intercept calls him or her, is being hailed as A Second Snowden. Someone who is willing to risk charges of treason and espionage to get word out to the public about what the American government is up to. Edward Snowdens big release had to do with the government spying on everyone and everything inside and outside the nation. The new leaker who remains anonymous at the hour of this writing is all about drones. On Thursday morning, The Intercept published online (this means that like a diamond, the story is forever) an multi-page outline of the USAs vaunted drone program titled The Drone Papers. In this expose, readers can find out all sorts of things about drones in the age of Obama: the terminology, how objectives are chosen, the number of people killed with them, information from studies that were obviously supposed to remain classified including Power Point slides marked Secret on developing and authorizing a target, the turf war between the Pentagon and the CIA over operations in Afghanistan, realities about depending on foreign governments for intelligence information, and much more. According to the report, before Barack Obama occupied the Oval Office, the United States had actually launched only one drone strike in November of 2002. During Obamas tenure over 490 people have been killed by our drone strikes, and at one point in Yemen there was a strike every six days. The drone campaign right now really is only about killing. When you hear the phrase capture/kill, capture is actually a misnomer. In the drone strategy that we have, capture is a lower case c. We dont capture people anymore, Lt. Gen. Michael Flynn, former head of the Defense Intelligence Agency, told The Intercept. Our entire Middle East policy seems to be based on firing drones. Thats what this administration decided to do in its counterterrorism campaign. Theyre enamored by the ability of special operations and the CIA to find a guy in the middle of the desert in some shitty little village and drop a bomb on his head and kill him. For quite a while rumors have circulated that Obama has a thing for drones and would sit and watch the footage like it was a video game or sports. There is little mention of that in this expose, but this leak confirms that at the beginning of his administration, Obama learned about drones from the CIA, and was persuaded to use them as a primary tool in the fight against Al Qaeda. (Interesting that George W. Bush resisted.) Rather than capturing targets, and interrogating them to find out more information about the network and get intelligence as airtight as possible, the Obama Administration is hell bent on just taking out the target and they are willing to create collateral damage that could be avoided to do it. This happens not just in Afghanistan, and Iraq, but Somalia, Yemen, and a number of other countries that are a stretch for our military to reach from the continuous 48 even with extra fuel as drones are based on this side of the globe. One of the most disturbing allegations in The Intercepts writings is that drone strikes are undertaken with intelligence that really isnt adequate, and the reality made perfectly clear in this report is that intelligence could be improved by not outright killing the targets without anyone on the ground to collect more information. As well, intelligence is never completely airtight, but it should be more than flimsy. And it certainly shouldnt depend on cell phone intercepts, as is charged in section six of the expose. Those [intelligence] shortfalls stemfrom the remote geography of Yemen and Somalia and the limited American presence there. As a result, the U.S. military has been overly reliant on signals intelligence from computers and cellphones, and the quality of those intercepts has been limited by constraints on surveillance flights in the region. Then there is the matter of fighting a war via remote control assassination rather than going to a location and actually shooting. Technically speaking, assassination is not allowed in American war theaters without cause, and is really a lazy way to conduct a conflict. But, this report intimates that this is the path the Obama Administration chose to take. The full report is illuminating and does not give away TOO many state secrets, but the revelations do confirm the worst fears of those who saw the U.S. drone program as presented by the Obama Adminstration as a means to an end just too disturbing. Its a short-cut to real war, and in the end an expensive, borderline immoral and slapdash one at that. The full report, The Drone Papers, is worth reading and can be found at The Intercept. It begins: From his first days as commander in chief, the drone has been President Barack Obamas weapon of choice, used by the military and the CIA to hunt down and kill the people his administration has deemed through secretive processes, without indictment or trial worthy of execution. There has been intense focus on the technology of remote killing, but that often serves as a surrogate for what should be a broader examination of the states power over life and death. ",3
2,"Over One-Third Of Refugees In Vermont Have This Infectious Disease In another sign that times have changed drastically from when new immigrants and refugees were coming through Ellis Island and subject to months of quarantine due to concerns that newcomers would bring infectious diseases into the country, it turns out that upon arrival in Vermont, a full third of the people claiming refugee status are carriers of latent Tuberculosis. Since 2013, about900 refugees admittedto theGreen Mountain State have been tested fortuberculosis,a potentially fatal infectious disease affecting the lungs. Of that number, 318 refugees, or 35.4 percent, tested positive. According to IGRA (Interferon-Gamma Release Assays)blood test resultsfrom 2013 to the present, the highest percentage of incoming refugees to Vermont infected with TBoccurred in 2013. That year, 108 refugees out of 248 tested, or 43.6 percent, showed positive for TB. Considering that in the United States AMERICANS are tested for TB on a regular basis and are subject to treatment sometimes on condition of employment, thats quite a lapse in allowing people into the country with a potentially fatal disease. Ben Truman of the Vermont Department of Health downplayed the seriousness of the rate of latent infections to watchdog.org, claiming that the chances of TB in the carrier form developing into full blown tuberculosis is not likely to happen. The Vermont five-year average of active TB cases for 2011 to 2015 is 5.4 cases, with a range of two to eight cases per year, Truman said. Considering that TB is a horrific lung disease when it is active and is sure to infect far more people in that state which is why every hospital in the country has a private isolation room just for TB patients the reality that a full third to almost half of the refugees being let into the country and resettled all over the place having even latent Tuberculosis is downright maddening. As it happens, American taxpayers are increasingly irrate at the concept that we the people are paying not just for refugees who may or may not embrace our way of life to live among us in the form of welfare, but for increased health care costs as the people coming into the country have infectious diseases that must be treated aggressively in order to keep the rest of us from getting sick. Refugee resettlement is facing freshscrutiny afterPresident Obama pledged to admit 100,000 refugees to the United States, up from the priorcap of 70,000. As distinguished fromimmigrants, refugees are people who have fled their countries due to war or persecution. State Refugee Coordinator Denise Lamoureux saidVermontplans to admit 350 refugees this year. One hundredrefugees maybe placed inRutland, where Mayor Chris Louras is facing a backlash from residents for hiding the citysresettlement plans from the public. Vermont is not the only state to face these issues. Arizona is reporting a high number of latent TB cases from refugees that we are assured is a world-wide problem. The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Preventionreports thattuberculosis is common worldwide, with one out of every three people carrying the bacteriumMycobacterium tuberculosis. In 2014, about9.6 million people had active TBand1.5 million people died from the disease. TB disease is rare in the United States, however, with just 9,421 active TB cases reported in 2014. And that is the way we would like to keep it, thank you very much. ",3
2,"Peaceful #Ferguson Protester Charged With Arson; Fellow Protesters Raise Cash To Bail Him Out In one of the more surreal Ferguson stories, one of the younger, more liked peaceful protesters, Josh Williams, was arrested and charged with arson of a QuikTrip in Berkeley, Missouri (pretty much next to Ferguson in North St. Louis County) following the death of Antonio Martin who was killed in a confrontation with police earlier in the week. From the St. Louis Post-Disgraces online page, stltoday.com: St. Louis County police arrested Joshua Williams, 19, of St. Louis, on Friday after several local media outlets and store surveillance captured images of him trying to set a pile of wood on fire outside the QuikTrip on North Hanley Road early Wednesday. [Christmas Eve] Williams confessed to setting fires at the store in a videotaped interview, according to court documents. Police say Williams entered the QuikTrip shortly after looters shattered its glass doors during protests of the death of Antonio Martin, 18, who a police officer had shot earlier at the Mobil station across the street. Surveillance footage from the Mobil store shows Martin point what police say is a gun at a Berkeley officer before the officer fatally shoots him. Williams can be seen in videos both inside and outside the looted QuikTrip, authorities said. Cant argue with surveillance video and confessions in court documents. Not 24 hours after the report surfaced that Mr. Williams had been arrested much to the dismay of the actual peaceful clergy who have been prominent in the Ferguson situation, this appeared on the Twitter feed of one of the most obnoxious of the local protesters: Think about that. A Ferguson protester and live streamer who has also been arrested is crowdfunding the bail for an arsonist. The link leads to the donate page for the Legal Support Fund forJustice for Mike Brown protesters page. Theyre sticking together in an us vs. them fashion. While Mr. Williams has been arrested for unlawful assembly and other non-destructive charges related to protesting, this is the first destruction of property related felony on his rap sheet. This is very disappointing to a number of people in the actual peaceful protest and discussion group. Josh is one of the young activists, and all of us have taken close to him. We got to know his heart, and he got to know ours, said Bishop Derrick Robinson, of Kingdom Destiny Fellowship International. Hes a great kid, an educated kid, a child who knows what he wants and is very active in the community.Yet he set a woodpile outside a QuikTrip on fire and later confessed to it. And the other prominent protesters are bailing him out. That should tell everyone something. innocent til proven guilty If this kid is so educated he should know that it is against the law to burn and destroy other peoples property. ",3
2,"Warning From UK: Sharia Courts Abusive Towards Women Back in 1996, the United Kingdom (Britain) passed a piece of legislationcalled the Arbitration Act. The idea was to let citizens settle certain disputes among themselves rather than taking the matter to an official court. The law allows an outside court as it were, do the work along with the provision that whatever agreement is reached must be binding according to British law. Fast forward a couple decades, and with the influx of so many Muslims, full fledged Sharia courts, or tribunals, have bloomed in England. The problem: Sharia courts do not give a fig for the home countrys laws. Most specifically, there is zero respect for the British law that ensures womens rights. That has Baroness Caroline Cox, a member of the House of Lords, not in a charitable mood. Last month, she published a 40-page report via The Bow Group titled A Parallel World: Confronting the abuse of many Muslim women in Britain today. In the preface, she writes: While wholeheartedly endorsing freedom of religion, I am deeply concerned at the problems faced by women and girls in Britain who are suffering from religiously-sanctioned gender discrimination. I have sat and wept with those who are oppressed, abused and treated as second class citizens. One Muslim woman told me: I feel betrayed by Britain. I came here to get away from this and the situation is worse here than in the country I escaped from. Sharia courts have taken full advantage of the Arbitration Act and have been regularly treating Muslim women in Britain like second class citizens. The problem Baroness Cox has is not so much the freedom of religion aspect of the matter, but that women may not understand that in Britain Sharia Court decisions may not be legally binding. From The Gatestone Institute: Muslim women, who may lack knowledge of both the English language and their rights under British law, are often pressured by their families to use Sharia courts. These courts often coerce them to sign an agreement to abide by their decisions, which are imposed and viewed as legal judgments. That was not the intent of the Arbitration Act. As usual with Muslims that is the tact they have taken though, and the women suffer as a result. The report outlines the number of ways the Muslim Imams have simply taken over law enforcement within their own communities many times through mosques. Sharia forums are understood to be operating out of mosques around the country or through other arrangements, such as meetings of community elders, which are being presented within particular communities as making authoritative and legally binding rulings. British Indian author and journalist Edna Fernandes, after her own investigation, concluded that scores more imams dispense justice through their own mosques and that sharia is being used informally within the Muslim community to tackle crime such as gang fights or stabbings, bypassing police and the British court system. Britain is now experiencing what the United States is facing if the concept of Sharia Courts is not addressed and soundly squelched. For women, the specific issues faced that are outlined in the report are ostracization, threats, intimidation, claims that Sharia Law takes precedence over civil law, etc. Because of the cultural influences and deliberate isolation, girls and women suffering from domestic violence, marriages that are not legally binding in Britain, and those who are in polygamous marriages and do not wish to be are very reluctant to go to civil authorities for help. Interesting facts from a study of 50 Muslim women in the British West Midlands are: Around 90 per cent of those who identified as being married were not in marriages legally recognised by English law. Of these women, over half were not aware that they do not have the same rights as they would have with a civil marriage. Some of the women interviewed assumed that, because the Nikah (Islamic wedding ceremony) had taken place in the UK, it automatically counted as a valid marriage. Two thirds of those who identified as being married said their husband has more than one wife. In mainstream Islam, a husband does not have to undertake the same process as the wife when seeking a Talaq (Islamic divorce). He merely has to say I divorce you three times, whereas the wife must meet various conditions and pay a fee. Some of the women interviewed, when speaking of their own Talaq proceedings, specifically referred to their lack of legal protection after discovering that their Nikah did not constitute a valid marriage under English law. In this way, Sharia Law does not serve women well, and certainly not as equal to men save the natural differences God gave us. In addition to the summary of abuses toward women and violations of the British Arbitration Act outlined in the summary, there are a number of testimonials in the second segment of the report telling of Muslim women applying for divorce in Sharia Court and not being granted their freedom despite the husband having moved on, non-consent, and more. There are stories of women being told they must surrender their children. There is clear demonstration that using the Sharia Courts and Councils over civil authorities in Britain does not serve these womens interests. I feel betrayed by Britain. I came here to get away from this and the situation is worse here than in the country I escaped from. Baroness Cox has taken on the challenge of getting British law changed to better serve these women. The third part of her report includes recommendations for Britain taking back authority. So far, interest in Britain for correcting the problem exists, but it does not seem to be a priority. Cox will be introducing a bill in the upcoming Parliament to address these issues. The governments response will be a litmus test of the extent to which it genuinely upholds the principle of equality before the law or is so dominated by the fear of giving offense that it will continue to allow these women to suffer in ways which would make our suffragettes turn in their graves. Would that American feminists feel the same. This is why I need feminism: 1) Female genital mutilation 2) Punishing rape victims 3) Honor killing 4) Strapping bombs to children 5) Sexually enslaving women 6) Murdering homosexuals 7) Child marriage 8) Domestic Violence 9) Disciplining or Punishing Wives ",4
2,"States Buck Federal Courts on Gay Marriage After Americas founders overthrew King George III, they were in no mood to have an overly strong central government take his placeso they limited the federal government to delegated powers. Thats when we were called these United States. The battle over same-sex marriage has put the delegated powers and the long-dormant issue of states rights in the forefront as four states buck federal courts over same-sex unions. Despite votes by the people in 21 states to keep the traditional definition of marriage and ban same-sex marriage, federal courts have trumped the peoples will. Last month, Alabamas Chief Supreme Court Justice Roy Moore and Alabama Gov. Robert Bentley agreed not to enforce a federal district courts decision allowing gay marriage, with Moore writing to the governor, As you know, nothing in the United States Constitution grants the federal government the authority to redefine the institution of marriage. Alabama is not alone as three other southern states have joined the fight, the New York Times reports. Republican-dominated state legislatures in Texas, Oklahoma and South Carolina have introduced bills that would forbid local or state government employees from giving licenses for same-sex marriages. The bills would also take away the salaries of employees that issue those licenses, despite federal court overturning such bans as unconstitutional. Besides that, South Carolina, North Carolina and Utah would allow officials to opt out of involvement in same-sex marriage based on religious convictions. Even if the United States Supreme Courts, in a currently pending case, decides same-sex marriages must be allowed in all 50 states, as it is in 36 states and the District of Columbia, the controversy is not likely to go away. The millions of people who voted that marriage is a union of a man and a woman are not simply going to throw their beliefs away, said South Carolina Republican Senator Lee Bright. This fight will continue on regardless of which way the Supreme Court rules. A federal judge in November overturned a 2006 constitutional amendment limiting marriage to a woman and a man approved by 78 percent of South Carolinavoters. Bright is the sponsor of a bill permiting government employees to opt out of issuing marriage licenses on religious grounds, similar to laws that allow medical workers not to be involved in abortions. Some opponents of gay marriage see similarities to the battle over abortion that did not end after the 1973 Roe v. Wade decision legalized abortion. In some ways, this is a constitutional battle of amendments between the 14th, which guarantees that no state shall deny to any person within its jurisdiction the equal protection of its laws andoriginally was intendedto protect blacks after the Civil War, and the 10th, which says, the powers not delegated to the United States by the Constitution, nor prohibited by it to the States, are reserved to the States respectively, or to the people. If the 14thAmendment means the federal courts can impose on the states whatever their issue of the day is, what is the value of the 10th? The states bucking the federal judiciary may seem like defiance. But defiance, Jack Kenny writes in the New American, is sometimes the only way the people in their respective states can attempt to check a federal government that exceeds the authority delegated to it in our Constitution. So argued James Madison and Thomas Jefferson in their writings against the federal Alien and Sedition Acts in the Virginia and Kentucky Resolutions. After the Supreme Court delivered its Dred Scott decision in 1857, Abraham Lincoln did not call for defiance, but he did suggest that a Supreme Court decision may be subject to ongoing challenges. As he stated in his first Inaugural Address: I do not forget the position assumed by some that constitutional questions are to be decided by the Supreme Court, nor do I deny that such decisions must be binding in any case upon the parties to a suit as to the object of that suit, while they are also entitled to very high respect and consideration in all parallel cases by all other departments of the Government. At the same time, the candid citizen must confess that if the policy of the Government upon vital questions affecting the whole people is to be irrevocably fixed by decisions of the Supreme Court, the instant they are made in ordinary litigation between parties in personal actions the people will have ceased to be their own rulers, having to that extent practically resigned their Government into the hands of that eminent tribunal. The people of 21stcentury America have largely ceased to be their own rulers, due in no small part to an exaggerated deference to that eminent tribunal. Such measures as are now being considered in a few of our states are a sign that the republican spirit, though long slumbering, is not yet dead.

2,"Russian Bombers Buzz North American Coast: Cold War Redux Or Is Putin Just In A Snit? Not this again: Two Russian strategic bombers conducted practice cruise missile attacks on the United States during a training mission last week that defense officials say appeared timed to the NATO summit in Wales. The Russian Tu-95 Bear bombers were tracked flying a route across the northern Atlantic near Iceland, Greenland, and Canadas northeast. Analysis of the flight indicated the aircraft were conducting practice runs to a pre-determined launch boxan optimum point for firing nuclear-armed cruise missiles at U.S. targets, said defense officials familiar with intelligence reports. Its bad enough that Russia is saber-rattling (more likely flashing not so polite sign language our way), but to add insult to injury, theyre not even being sneaky about buzzing U.S. airspace. Our frenemy Vladimir Putin is sendingTu-95 Bears, a Korean War era turbo prop airplane so loud that submarines can hear them underwater. In American slang, thats called in your face to the leadership in the drained swamp was call a nations capitol. The prevailing theory at the Free Beacon piece quoted above is that Vladmir Putin and his band of merry KGB retirees strategically timed these rehearsals to coincide with NATO meetings. It seems that there is a Cold War hangover mentality still hovering in Moscow driving these practice drills: Disclosure of the nuclear bombing practice comes as a Russian general last week called for Moscow to change its doctrine to include preemptive nuclear strikes on the United States and NATO. Gen. Yuri Yakubov, a senior Defense Ministry official, was quoted by the state-run Interfax news agency as saying that Russias 2010 military doctrine should be revised to identify the United States and the NATO alliance as enemies, and clearly outline the conditions for a preemptive nuclear strike against them. Here we go again. There is a very definite possibility of being dragged into yet another conflict we did not exactly provoke and squaring off with an enemy determined to kill us all if they have to. Weve done this before. From 1946-ish until 1989. For over forty years, the United States and Russia, I mean the Union of Soviet and Socialist Republics (socialist republic is an oxymoron if there ever was one), squared off in a war that had no formal battles, but plenty of proxy conflicts and casualties and cost us a lot of money. When the Soviets parked nuclear cruise missiles off the coast of Florida in the 60s, rather than firing them and finishing us off at the time, they blinked. Does all this mean they are itching for a do-over? Not that there is much chance of being able to strike against the entire country from the Labrador Sea, but considerable damage could be done from there: The Tu-95 is a nuclear-capable bomber that is outfitted with six AS-15 nuclear-armed cruise missiles. The missiles have a range of over 1,800 miles. Google Earth analysis reveals that a Tu-95 launch box located in the Labrador Sea and firing AS-15 missiles would be in range of Ottawa, New York, Washington, and Chicago, and could reach as far south as the Norfolk Naval base. Theres a lot more that could be targeted on the east coast, but any of those targets alone being in the cross-hairs is a cause for sleep loss. What makes this more hair raising is that this bullying behavior started seven years ago: Mark Schneider, a former Pentagon strategic policymaker and currently senior analyst at the National Institute for Public Policy, said Russian leaders frequently issue public nuclear threats because they regard their nuclear arsenal as the main element of their great power status. Putin began what he called bomber combat patrols in 2007 and they continue, Schneider said. They are designed to intimidate as well as practice nuclear bomber attacks. He said the threats have included nuclear exercises, bomber flights, and public statements, including Putins suggestion that NATO not mess with us because Moscow remains a nuclear power. Northern Command has confirmed that Russian strategic bomber flights increased sharply over the past six months. Last month, at least 16 bomber incursions by the Russians took place within the northwestern U.S. and Canadian air defense zones over a period 10 days. It was the largest number of incursions since the end of the Cold War. U.S. fighter jets intercepted the Russian aircraft and followed them until they excited the defense zone. In June, Russian bombers flew over the arctic prompting intercepts by Canadian fighters on two occasions. The Canadian government called the stepped up bomber flights a strategic message from Moscow amid heightened tensions. And on June 20, the Russian Defense Ministry announced the test launch of six AS-15 missiles from a Bear bomber during military exercises. That same month, on June 9, two Russian Bear bombers flew within 50 miles of the California coast in the closest strategic bomber flights near a U.S. coast since the Cold War with the Soviet Union. This latest incident is all about NATO and reminding the rest of the world that Russia is still a nuclear power? Thats quite a laundry list of fly-bys for a simple saber-rattling episode. And what is the United States doing to counter these threatening moves? Barack Obama pledged a military presence in the Baltic countries last week and pledged the protection of NATO to Estonia, Lithuania and Latvia, all of which split from the old Soviet Union as fast as they could when the opportunity arose. Some sources claim that the three teeny tiny nations are American puppet countries and this is no more than an offensive defense move. Could be. No military action in Ukraine, though, so the sincerity of the Obama Regime is definitely in question. No indication if we are buzzing the Polijarny Inlet where the famed Russian Navy Northern Fleet base lies, either. Ask people in the military about the end of the Cold War and you will hear that it didnt really end, it was just put on the back burner. After twenty-five years, it looks to be heating up again. At the height of Cold War I, cooler heads prevailed rather than trying to annihilate the enemy. Lets hope this version of the USSR/Russia displays that sort of patience. Really, though, sixty year old bombers? Doesnt Putin have anything higher tech? ",3
2,"Kerry - Refrigerators Are As Deadly As ISIS John Kerry is not stupid although all outward appearances and his utterances belie that fact. Hes a self-enriching globalist traitor to America but that just makes his a scumbag, not a stupid scumbag. Hes proving that point through comments and actions that he took on Friday. Kerry was in Vienna to play God with other control freaks in banning the way most of us at home and in commercial applications keep cool and keep our food from spoiling. Comfort as well as a safe and plentiful food supply for the common infidels are the enemy of out esteemed Secretary of State. Hes got his fairy tale control grid to protect and that comes first. Misrepresenting the legitimacy and incorrectly labeling a villain in his profiteering operation, Kerry said that the refrigerants they were in the process of banning were as big of a threat to life as the ISIS killers. We must all be vigilant for Islamic refrigerators or air conditioners that appear to be out of place. If theyre running and something doesnt sound or look right, call 911 to see something, say something. Ask the emergency operator is your refrigerator running? Theyll send someone right over. As reported by The Washington Examiner, Kerry was in Vienna. His mission is to further restrict, control and force conformity into the UN Sustainable Development 2030 mandates. The method at hand is the amendment of the 1987 Montreal Protocol, eliminating hydrofluorocarbons (HFC). They are presently found in basic household and commercial appliances like air conditioners, refrigerators, and inhalers. Kerry said, Yesterday, I met in Washington with 45 nations defense ministers and foreign ministers as we were working together on the challenge of [the Islamic State], and terrorism. Its hard for some people to grasp it, but what we you are doing here right now is of equal importance because it has the ability to literally save life on the planet itself. Those some people which Kerry derides are known as intelligent and possessing common sense, able to recognize a scam when they see one. Kerry argued that the banning of substances in the Montreal Protocol has increased the use of HFCs, which he now also seeks to ban. He claimed that the coolant was thousands of times more potent than CO2, adding that the increase of HFCs has lead to the trend of global climate change, his most reliable threat to justify his wresting of control. The use of hydrofluorocarbons is unfortunately growing, Kerry said. Already, the HFCs use in refrigerators, air conditioners, and other items are emitting an entire gigaton of carbon dioxide-equivalent pollution into the atmosphere annually. Now, if that sounds like a lot, my friends, its because it is. Its the equivalent to emissions from nearly 300 coal-fired power plants every single year. Didnt Saddam Hussein call his victims his friends too? In further attempting to legitimize his seizing of control over the ability of commoner infidels to preserve their food and live in comfort, Kerry said, Members of the Montreal Protocol have met their obligations and have aided in the shrinking of the hole in the ozone, as well as created jobs and improved the quality of life. It sounds like hes making arguments against his power grab. If everything is getting better, lets just forget the whole idea. If more cuts need to be made and hes really serious that it needs to be done, he could start with eliminating Heinz condiments and food products. If they dont exist they wont need to be refrigerated and destroying his own empire before our lives would be a great way for Kerry to prove hes sincere. Any shot at credibility or sincerity went out the window with the involvement of the EPA Energy Troll, Gina McCarthy. The regimes Power and Quality of Life Nazi announced that she plans to implement an HFC agreement by the end of this year. Naturally we wont have any say in the matter. Its for our own good to fight the convenient villain of climate change. We can shut up and take it. It would be interesting to see who is invested in and set to profit from the replacement of equipment and conversion to gases dictated to be used after the new mandates are adopted. Odds are theyre Obamas corporate cronies, his green stuff comrades. The winning money is on a Clinton Foundation and Green Climate Slush Fund connection. ",3
2,"Study Examines Environmental Impact Of Veggies. Oops, Lettuce Is More Harmful Than... Researchers trying to justify a mostly plant based diet for humans are reeling from the results yielded by a study that seems to put lettuce in the crosshairs of environmental righteousness. When one considers what it takes to get food to market in its totality water, sun, growing space, feeding, fuel, packaging, etc. the oh, so smart ones at Carnegie Mellon University in Pittsburgh started looking as the entire total impact of the human diet on the planet and made a startling discovery. Lettuce is over three times worse in greenhouse gasemissions than eating bacon, Researchers did not argue against the idea people should be eating less meat, or the fact that livestock contributes to an enormous proportion of global emissions up to 51 per cent according to some studies. But they found that eating only the recommended healthier foods prescribed in recent advice from the US Department of Agriculture increased a persons impact on the environment across all three factors even when overall calorie intake was reduced. The study was published in the Environment Systems and Decisions peer reviewed journal, and studied emissions, water use, and energy costs. While it is true that plants do soak up all that carbon dioxide that animals exhale, it is also true that they soak up a lot of water particularly kitchen garden fare that ends up being half water when it is eaten. Paul Fischbeck, study co-author and CMUs professor of social and decisions sciences, said: Lots of common vegetables require more resources per calorie than you would think. Eggplant, celery and cucumbers look particularly bad when compared to pork or chicken. People who have actually raised fruits and vegetables will not be shocked by this. No way, Jose. Ever see a garden or an orchard during a drought? Can you say dead as a doornail with teeny tiny yields if any? Obviously, these people dont cook, either. Veggies always cook down. Where was I? Oh, yes, the shocking discovery that lettuce uses up a lot of resources on its way to market in comparison to meat and poultry. Lets think about this, shall we? This is not to say that humans should not eat their vegetables and some fruit. Particularly lettuce with extra virgin olive oil (lowers blood pressure). But the leftie, looney liberal panacea of all humans eating vegan to save the planet is proving to be precisely the opposite of reality. Shipping high water content fruits and vegetables negates the environmental pluses of the foods. Yes, it is now safe to ask WHERES THE BEEF? ",3

2,"Elite War Mongers Warn Against Trump - FOLLOW THE MONEY Anytime you want to know what a man stands for, check out his enemies. In 2016, since billionaire businessman Donald Trump has taken on his peers in the billionaire realm, aka the establishment power brokers, his ideological enemies have come out of the closet. Those opposing his America First economic policies have been publicly knashing their teeth for months fretting that all the America First rhetoric is going to make their overseas factories less profitable when Trump renegotiates trade deals. Same thing is happening with the green energy people who only invest in it when there are government subsidies. Now, its time for the elite war mongers to have their turn. On Monday, the New York Times now the standard conduit for direct, 3rd party, passive aggressive messaging published an open statement from 50 of the people who have brought us near constant war for the last 25 years. In the letter they condemn Donald Trumps reckless foreign policy ideaswhich essentially run counter to theirs. The letter is basically two pages of politically correcteuphemisms and repeated accusations that dont have any basis in fact when looking at Trumps record objectively. Those signing the letter itself are the sorts of people who go to work for think tanks, lobbying firms, and vested private industry all while banking on the fact that they were part of an administration that went to war at some point or another. (A lot of them are former Bush 43 administration people.) For the most part, commenters out on the fruited plain have heard of a small fraction of these people. One former CIA head, two former Homeland Security Secretaries, a White House staffer or two are among the names which are actually recognizable. Many of the rest were deputies within the defense and intelligence apparatus and the State Department. That tells us one thing: they are making a living in the corporate and think tank worlds off of having been part of a government at war. One thing Trump has made very clear in his campaigning is his aversion to going to war when we a) dont need to, and b) cant afford it. He has also expressed a keen interest in reassessing our formal military relationships with our allies (NATO, etc.) and facing the reality that the United States cannot continue to fund so many other countries defense for them. FOLLOWING THE MONEY Consider for a moment the common theme here: finances, economics, cash, monetary gain. Trumps main messaging thrust is putting America first in everything. That means before making trade deals, going to war or any other foreign policy issue is acted upon the question How will this effect the country mind, body, soul and pocketbook must be considered. Is it worth it from every perspective including the loss of human life has to be paramount in mind. After that is answered, the question for Trump, who is not a member of the Council on Foreign Relations, the Trilateral Commission or any of the other vested interests here, is can we afford it. After all, next to entitlements, war is about the most expensive thing the government does. And weve been footing the defense bill for a lot of other countries for a long time. Were TRILLIONS of dollars in debt due to the combination of runaway entitlements and constantly being at war with no chance to pay off previous debt. Its as if someone out there WANTS to bankrupt the United States. (Yes, Im well aware of the central banks role in all of this.) What the letter/statement attempts to do is paint a walk boldly and carry a big stick sort of guy as a chicken-livered coward. Nothing could be further from the truth. If anything, Trump would be more likely to go all out in a war just to get it over with than pussy-foot around and fight in waves just to drag it all out for profit. In fact, Trumps response was a full-on assault on the greedy pansies. The names on this letter are the ones the American people should look to for answers on why the world is a mess, and we thank them for coming forward so everyone in the country knows who deserves the blame for making the world such a dangerous place. They are nothing more than the failed Washington elite looking to hold onto their power, and its time they are held accountable for their actions. These insiders along with Hillary Clinton are the owners of the disastrous decisions to invade Iraq, allow Americans to die inBenghazi, and they are the ones who allowed the rise of ISIS. Yet despite these failures, they think they are entitled to use their favor trading to land taxpayer-funded government contracts and speaking fees. Its time we put our foot down and declare that their gravy train is over: no longer will Crooked Hillary Clinton and the other disasters in Washington get rich at our expense. In so many ways, the candidacy of Donald Trump has opened the eyes of Americans to what our leaders and elite have been up to: a massive wealth transfer from the American taxpayers to the people who perpetuate war. Its not the wealth transfer we usually think of, but one that does ring true when considered honestly. Yes, it is in the national interest to have a strong national defense. It is not in the national interest to be constantly using it to benefit someone else. That is Trumps point, and truth be told, that is the base sentiment of the American people, even those of us who come from defense families. Weve now heard from the war monger arm of the elite sans Henry Kissinger, Condi Rice and a few others who are smart enough to stay out of the fray. Trump stomped them like a narc at a biker rally. Well see if any of it has an effect. ",3
2,"Following The Money: Foreign Governments Buying Influence Via Think Tanks It seems that in order for foreign countries to get the attention of U.S. lawmakers and to try to influence policy here for their own benefit, they are exploiting a loophole in non-profit tax reporting law that applies to 501(c)(4)s, or the sorts of non-profits where major donors are allowed to remain anonymous in exchange for not getting a tax credit. (These non-profits are the same classification as the TEA Party-Conservative non-profits that were denied status by the IRS for years under Lois Lerner.) The research institutions we know of as Think Tanks fall into this category, and it seems that countries such as Japan, Norway, China, Qatar, United Arab Emirates and many more are using them as lobbying firms since U.S. law expressly prohibits foreign governments from soliciting influence with Congress directly. From an explosive New York Times report. Troubling? Try should be setting off alarm bells all over America. There is a reason why it is illegal in this country for foreign governments to lobby Congress. Congress exists, supposedly, to represent the interests of the people and the states, not foreign powers. On the one hand, it is heartening to know that the US still has the kind of influence around the world that prompts other governments to try to get us to see things their way, but our government exists to serve us, not them. An accompanying piece to the main NYT article outlines from where some serious money is making its way to the following think tanks: And thats just nine out of twenty eight think tanks on the take. The money is coming from all over the globe and it seems that foreign governments consider this to be investment capital as opposed to simply funding research. Foreign officials describe these relationships as pivotal to winning influence on the cluttered Washington stage, where hundreds of nations jockey for attention from the United States government. The arrangements vary: Some countries work directly with think tanks, drawing contracts that define the scope and direction of research. Others donate money to the think tanks, and then pay teams of lobbyists and public relations consultants to push the think tanks to promote the countrys agenda. Push foreign agendas with OUR government. Could it be that the think tanks which have a patina ofacademic neutrality and objectivity are truly being used in exchange for grant money that the U.S. government is no longer providing? Prostituting themselves for cash and compromising research? At this time, 501(c)(4)s are not required to report the amount of revenue coming from foreign sources. As a result of the New York Times reporting, according to the Washington Free Beacon: A rule changehas been introduced in the House to require think tanks to disclose sources of foreign funding when they testify before Congress. Its a solid proposal. But it does not go far enough. Congress should pass a law making contributions to think tanks by foreign governments and foreign nationals subject to [the Foreign Agents Registration Act]. What else could that money be for, if not to influence policy and public opinion to further foreign interests? Here is one area where transparency is vital. Let the money be disclosed. Or let it dry up. Not that the Department of Justice is the most trustworthy when it comes to enforcing law meant to benefit Americans these days, but think tanks should be required to register at foreign agents if they take foreign money and then produce research reflecting pre-determined outcomes.

2,"$30,000 Offered for Arrests in Deputy Killing Police in the town of Round Rock, Texas, just outside of Austin, are looking for the killer of a Deputy Sheriff on Monday. But at the current time according to the department, they have little to go on. But the area has rallied to help find the killer and together the towns people have raised about $30,000 in rewards. That money has now been offered for information leading to arrests in the cowardly fatal shooting of a Texas sheriffs deputy at his Austin-area home. In addition to the money raised locally, the Texas Crime Stoppers program announced Tuesday a $15,000 reward for information leading to suspects in the killing of Travis County sheriffs Sgt. Craig Hutchinson. Hutchinson was gunned down early Monday in Round Rock after using his law enforcement radio to report prowlers in his yard. Hutchinson, who was set to retire in September, later died of his wounds at a local hospital. Sgt. Craig Hutchinson who was on the force for 32 years, used his law enforcement radio to call for help shortly before 1:30 a.m., and responding officers found Hutchinson laying in the back yard of his home, Travis County Sheriff Greg Hamilton said during a Monday news conference. He was my field training officer, Hamilton said.So this is near and dear to me. This guy was a big teddy bear and everybody loved him. He was a gentle bear and he taught me everything I knowI loved that guy to death. The reward from Texas Crime Stoppers, operating within the office of Gov. Greg Abbotts Criminal Justice Division, joins $10,000 posted by the U.S. Marshals Service. A municipal judge and ex-sheriffs office employee, Judge Kevin Madison, pledged a $5,000 reward for information leading to arrests. Dozens of mourners prayed and held hands during a vigil Monday night for Hutchinson. If you have any information about this case, you are urged to contact any Austin area Police Department. The have assured us that you name will be kept confidential. Sgt Hutchinson has been described by co-workers and neighbors as a friendly, caring officer that went out of his way to help people.

2,"WATCH: Fukushima Radiation Detected 100 Miles Off California Coast In March 2011, Tokyo Electric Power Co.s Fukushima Dai-Ichi in Japan suffered damages when the area was hit by an earthquake and released unprecedented levels of radioactivity. Reactors in the plant exploded despite being cooled by plant workers. At least three reactors suffered meltdowns during the ensuing explosions. Radioactive chemicals then leaked into the ocean. The water that was used to cool the fuel rods leaked into the ocean as well, sending further contamination into the water. The plant was de-commissioned, but even years later the cleanup process is still ongoing and isnt expected to be completed for decades at least. In 2013, Canadian oceanographers reported the presence of cesium-134 off the shores of Vancouver Island. According to Dictionary.com, cesium-134 is an isotope used in nuclear development that has a short half-life (decays to half of original amount within two years). An isotope, according to the Oxford Dictionary, is each of two or more forms of the same element that contain equal numbers of protons but different numbers of neutrons in their nuclei, and hence differ in relative atomic mass but not in chemical properties; in particular, a radioactive form of an element. Earlier this week, oceanographers detected levels of cesium-134 about 100 miles off of Californias northern coast. They assure the public that levels are far below any that could be a measurable health risk. Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution said on its website that the radioactivity detected off of Californias coast is more than 1,000 times lower than acceptable limits in drinking water set by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency. Ken Buesseler, marine chemist leading the analysis said that a swimmer who spent 6 hours a day for a year in water with 10 Bacquerels per cubic meter of cesium-134 would still receive 1,000 times less radiation than a dose from a single dental X-ray. A Becquerel is a unit of measure based on the number of radioactive decay events per second per 260 gallons of water, according to LiveScience.com. Buesseler stated, Its not a public health threat, but those last 100 miles are pretty tricky. The plant operator of the plant in Fukushima said in an emailed statement that the radiations spread had been expected and that the co. has significantly improved water management at the site since the accident. Watch the video of the nuclear plant explosion here: http://gizmodo.com/5781293/terrifying-video-of-nuclear-power-plant-explosion-in-japan Well folks if the EPA says something, we can automatically assume it is a lie, just like any other agency of the obamaswssss government . This has made it over the ocean, what else is coming? Good maybe Nancy Poliosy and Dianne Frankinstein will drink some of that nasty water!! The MSM ignores the story and hopes everyone forgets. Is anyone testing to see if it is getting in the food chain. Dont assume they are. I think many people think the Federal Government is doing things to protect us but it is all a charade. If they have tens of millions of human parasite illegal aliens here you think they are stopping isotopes? ",3
2,"What Kind Of BLM Moron Stands In A Busy Street At Night? A Hospitalized One This person proves that while Darwin may have been theologically incorrect, he did have some things right. His ideas about natural selection and survival of the fittest didnt include a warning not to stand in the middle of a major roadway in the middle of the night. Some things are best left to nature to sort out. Black lives matter as much as any other life, but no more, and stupid lives matter less. This person placed less value on his own life than he expected to be afforded by others. When youre raised up thinking that the world revolves around you, you might miss the reality that other people are interested in their own lives and to them not only do you not matter, you dont exist. The typical entitled, self-absorbed protester, preoccupied with disrupting and getting the cadence of your chant just right, could lose interest in their personal safety. Being afforded safe zones in which you can act like a child in a shopping cart that cant quite reach the bag of Skittles at the register sets the tantrum thrower up for a rude awakening. Whats he to do when the mommy of the real world doesnt hold up the line behind her to find out what the screaming brat is demanding? Standing in the street with a sign, this Einsteins solution, was the wrong choice. This BLM agitator was standing in the middle of the road at night, a dangerous proposition for a white person. For a black man, in a relatively dark section of a high speed roadway, he was begging to be hit. As politically incorrect as it may be to say, hes hard to see. Reality met his demands. BLMthugs are always creating chaos and demanding something. This guy should be demanding an apology from his safe zone brainwashers. How was he to know it didnt extend to the real world outside the one created by educators, Don Lemon, CNN and Eric Holder? Apparently this guy didnt die or it would be all over the news and hed be another BLM martyr whose stupidity is celebrated on some day in August and is supposed to now shape our decision making. Its actually surprising that this type of thing doesnt happen more often. Aggressive morons attempting to intimidate and assaulting innocent citizens, using their own civility as a weapon against them, deserve the consequences of their actions. Natural law doesnt care about political correctness or manipulated social status. Stupid is stupid equally in every color. Its possible that this guy learned a valuable lesson and when the third anniversary of dead thug Michael Browns assault on Darren Wilson is celebrated, this knucklehead may decide to stand on the shoulder of the road. Maybe he should just celebrate in the McDonalds parking lot or better yet, his own driveway. ",3
2,"DHS Ignores Law Requiring Deception Technology, Frustrates AZ Rep In a House Homeland Security Committee hearing on Wednesday, titled Shutting Down Terrorist Pathways into America, the same ineptitude and deliberate obstruction in matters related to national security was again on display. The very name of the hearing is at odds with the Obama Johnson approach to the terrorist threat to the United States. They work every day to make entry as easy as possible for anyone and everyone regardless of who they are or their intentions. They have no interest in shutting down terrorist pathways. Rep Martha McSalley (R-AZ) makes the point that she has repeatedly attempted to get those at DHS and the State Department and presumably their UN screeners as well, those who are responsible for approving the entry of unknown persons of questionable intent and background into America, to use deception detection technology for screening. The technology works, it is cheap and it is readily available. Yet all she continues to get out of the bureaucrats working for Johnson and Kerry is that theyll look into it. The frustrated Congresswoman notes that she is not merely asking that DHSlook into its use, it is incorporated into law and was included in 32 recommendations by a bi-partisan task force addressing the shortcomings in our screening process last year. Again, why would the regime that has greatly accelerated the importation of terrorists under the guise of refugees support the implementation of mechanisms that would become obstructions to their efforts to destroy America from within? Its much harder if their jihadis are outside the US than if they are committing terrorist acts on our own streets, in our own neighborhoods. She explains to the panel that even the best, most highly trained operatives can only detect deception in about 50 percent of the cases when a human being is lying to them. That means that half of them get through, and they are likely to be the more dangerous portion. McSalley points out, There is off-the-shelf technology out therethat can very cheaply and very easily help detect deception, while youre doing interviews overseas and other places and all the different ways that could be exploited. She asks, What, since the law was signed last year, directing DHS to investigate the use of deception detection technology, what has been done? She given non-answer responses, indicative of and consistent with a bureaucracy that is doing nothing to protect Americans. Under Jeh Johnson and Hussein Obama our borders have been opened up to anyone wanting to come in for a free ride on the American people or to do us harm. They also have not been shy in demonstrating their total lack of respect for the rule of law, particularly the immigration law that Johnson has declared null and void by memorandum. Rep McSalley must know shes not going to get anywhere with this group of anti-American turncoats. The only way national security will be pursued is through the elimination of the problems. That is the pair of traitors, Johnson and Obama responsible for the destructive policies. That means the defeat of Hillary Clinton and a victory for Donald Trump and the American people. ",3
2,"The Price On Salman Rushdies Head Just Got Higher On February 14, 1989, thenAyatollah Ruhollah Khomeini, the hardline leader of Iran, issued a fatwa or religious mission to anyone who could achieve it: kill author Salman Rushdie for the blasphemy included in his novel The Satanic Verses. Every year around that anniversary, the state run media outlets in Iran get together and occasionally up the bounty on his head for whoever can achieve the fatwa of Rushdies head. Last week, those state run agencies added another $600,000 to the pot, bringing the total to about $4 million dollars. The decree had already put a considerable price on Mr. Rushdies head: A religious organization called the 15 Khordad Foundation initially offered a $2.7 million reward to anyone carrying out the fatwa, then increased it to $3.3 million in 2012. The new money, bringing the total bounty to nearly $4 million, came from 40 news outlets listed by Fars, which said that it had contributed $30,000. The New York Times reports that there is a question on the matter of the bounty actually being paid. Most of the news agencies involved are actually state owned and subsidized. Their money is the government of Irans if they are making any at all. There have been back and forth reports that the fatwa itself was called off or finished in 1998, but the current Ayatollah considers the mission to be on as it were, and the raising of the bounty may well bring more people out of the woodwork after Rushdies life. According to multiple reports, political infighting has begun inside Iran, and this escalation of the bounty on Rushdies head may well be just a smokescreen. This is just to overshadow the elections, because the hard-liners and their media want to dissuade people from voting in large numbers, said Mojgan Faraji, a reformist journalist. She said the hard-liners drag up issues from the past to confuse people and to make other issues more important than voting. Whatever is the case, Rushdie needs another set of deadbolts.

2,"Liberal Confusion: UN Says US States Pot Legalization Violates International Conventions What is a liberal to do? Their go-to international agency when the good ole USA is veering in a direction they dont like, the vaunted front known as the United Nations, just said that the pushes to legalize marijuana, cannabis, pot, etc., in the United States albeit at a state level are not in line with international drug conventions. Whew thats a lot of words for the pot-addled brains to absorb all at once. But, the effort on the part of the United Nations to influence American law has now been announced. Yury Fedotov, executive director of the United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime (UNODC), intends to talk to the U.S. State Department about this next week. To the UN, it seems that individual American states voting on what laws to live by within their own borders just doesnt matter. I dont see how (the new laws) can be compatible with existing conventions, Fedotovtold reporters. Wait, theres conventions on pot usage? At the international level? Arent other countries legalizing the stuff? Its not just us. It seems that this is part of a trend. Maybe. On the international level, Uruguays parliament in late 2013 approved a bill to legalize and regulate the production and sale of marijuana the first country to do so. The International Narcotics Control Board (INCB) has said Uruguays new bill contravened the 1961 Single Convention on Narcotic Drugs, which it says requires states to limit the use of cannabis to medical and scientific purposes, due to its dependence-producing potential. The Vienna-based INCB monitors compliance with this and two other drug control treaties. We have drug control treaties? Did anyone tell the recreational drug use people in the Obama Administration, since they are UN dependent and are the ones that said it was okay for individual states to vote for themselves whether or not to legalize pot? (Laugh now, because this is going to get messy before its all over.) Not that the United Nations or most countries for that matter have much respect for the idea of states rights, but what we have here is one big ole conflict of law brought on by lawmakers not knowing what treaties, conventions and agreements are out there, and approved in decades past. Theres not much excuse for that from a presidential administration. Source article from Reuters. UN treaties are Human Rights violations. Garbage article is garbage An interesting expose for us liberals and pot-addled brains from a conservative with their usual alcohol-addled brain. I am 60 years old and no longer due drugs and the only damage drugs did to my life was caused me to spend a fortune in lawyers to get out drug bust . I am too a conservative .Prohibition never did work nor will if ever work . Our prisons are busting at the seems with non violent drug offenders and people that should not be on the streets are there on the streets to make room for these drug offenders .The UN has no business trying to tell us what we cant or cant do and we do need to get out of that socialist outdated , good for nothing outfit, the UN. We refuse to obey by Sharia law, UN law is just laughable! Hope my state follows suit and legalizes because it sickens me every time I see these bragging DEA agents laughing it up and talking about how they busted this person or that person essentially acting jovial at ruining a persons life and then in the same breath having the audacity to say that drugs destroy peoples lives. When the fact is that the war on drugs destroys far more lives in one year than drug use ever has. Prohibition never works just look at alcohol prohibition and the mafias that popped up after. We are still dealing with repercussions from that and that was 90 yrs. ago. Thanks to drug prohibition the cartels were born all because the government criminalized what essentially is a moral choice, and morality in a free country should never be enforced. Whether it be about gambling, drugs, prostitution or a gas guzzling SUV. Ok Fuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuck the UN Why is everything happening to the US? All these groups and nutjobs throughout the world wants everything that the US has but wants the US to fail. And if that doesnt take the cake, the UN, a defunct, corrupt organization seems to like making up its own twisted socialist rules and the people who fall for it are the panzy Europeans who have already bent over (forwards) for the crazy Muslims, and the idiotic liberals in the US who think that gun control is somehow going to put an end to violence. First we need to get over this perception that it only people on the left that are pro-legalization. I am pro-legal, and I am as Conservative as they come. I know many Conservatives that are pro-legal. Its more a generation thing. Older people are anti and younger people are pro. With that being said..F**K the U.N.!!! They are a sham. They are nothing but a bunch of idiots trying to rule the world and they have no authority over us. I have long said that we need to withdraw from them, quit funding them, and kick them the hell out of our country. ",3

A 10-year-old New Jersey girl, Elizabeth Blaine didnt hold back when telling her school board just how she felt about Common Core. This is crazy! I am one of the most gifted students in my grade, or so my mom says, and I have not even the slightest clue what this means, she added. Nonsense is putting it mildly. Common Core establishes more federal control over curriculum; it infringes on local and parental control, and there is no evidence that it will improve learning or educational results. ",1
2,"Watch The Little Known Story Of The 9/11 Boatlift Fourteen years later, we forget all but the horror of September 11, 2001, the morning our safety and security was gone forever. That day, the day New York City lost so much, thousands of people turned hero without even thinking twice. Among them were the owners and captains of the various ferries, tugs, and party boats that operated around Manhattan. Due to security concerns, following the attack that morning, all transportation was cut off to and from Manhattan. As a result millions of people were stranded on the island. Weve all seen the photographs of the millions of people who walked across the Brooklyn Bridge that morning, but not everyone knows about the 500,000 people evacuated via the water. The call from the Coast Guard went out, and the boats went to Manhattan to take the people home. This is their story. ",4

For his own sick reasons,he allegedly tortured his ex-girlfriend, locking her in a dog crate for hours at a time for over five months. One day she managed to escape and report this freak to the authorities. Frank Guerra, pleaded not guilty on Monday to charges including battery and kidnapping. He is barred from making contact with the girl and was denied bail. The abuse occurred between Aug. 1, 2015 and Jan. 4, 2016. The woman eventually escaped, but waited until February to contact police for unexplained reasons. She chooses to remain anonymous. Guerra allegedly locked the woman inside a 30-inch by 48-inch dog crate while he went to work each day, according to The Modesto Bee. She was reportedly forced to go to the bathroom in the cage and she has accused Guerra of smearing dog feces on her several times. [Guerra] bit her on the back and shell have permanent scarring,Deputy District Attorney Beth DeJong said in court. He locked her in a dog crate. [Sometimes] he pushed her to the ground and kicked her until shed go inside.

2,"RANT: OUTRAGE In Colorado Not About Who Won Or Lost, Its Much Deeper Now that the American people are awake and are paying attention to the full political process for the first time in over 100 years, it seems, what the Republican Party pulled in Colorado over the weekend is beginning to be the rallying cry for why the people no longer trust the group in charge. See, the Republican Party has been making itself clear that THEY do the nominating of their candidate regardless of the popular vote. Okay, fine, if thats the case, why bother with letting the people vote in any state? Well get back to that. My new favorite word is OLIGARCHY meaning a small group of people having control of a country, organization, or institution. Sort of likethe combined Democratic and Republican Parties and their funders controlling the federal government. Here in the United States, which is supposedly a Republic (well, it is in name anyway), the way the place really operates is around money. Specifically, the money belonging to the people at the top of the food chain. They pay lobbyists to convince the lawmakers who are supposedly elected by the people to look out for the peoples interests to look out for their interests instead. (They also pay the mainstream media and some alternative sites to push chosen narratives as well. All kinds of conflicts of interest on conservative favorites can be found here.) Not that this is really all that different than any other country out there, but in the United States in the last 40-50 years, coupling this with little or no trade barriers to entry into the country, but with plenty of trade barriers to the other countries on the planet where labor costs are lower, and the markets arent nearly as lucrative, the people controlling the government that would be the OLIGARCHY conveniently have things set up so that they can still profit while the rest of us. [Each reader may finish their sentence on his or her own.] In the last few days oligarchy has popped up multiple times on the blogosphere (do NOT trust MSM sources for accuracy any more). One commenter called the U.S. a corporate oligarchy, meaning that big business was at the helm. Another blogger, actually, used the word nihilist meaning the rejection of all religious and moral principles, often in the belief that life is meaningless. In the case of the American oligarchy, religion is effectively a non-factor unless it is used politically (which it should not be) and moral principles have been effectively neutered. To be technical, the oligarchy may well be simply globalist, since both corporatism and nihilism apply to that construct. Bottom line: in the USA, the political parties operate as machines and get their way with the same results we have been seeing in the big cities for over 100 years. Tammany Hall hasnt died. Its just gone national. And now, we clearly see it in both parties when the Republican version was not exposed to the naked eye or bad publicity for quite a while. Skipping over some relevant history of the 1920 Republican Convention, and the entire 1912 election, and any number of others where the same crap was pulled and the oligarchy got away with this kind of thing all the time because there was no such thing as readily available social media. Content in the news media was tightly controlled until 20 years ago. Sit down and really think about it, and the reason WHY Colorado and all the voter fraud that has been glossed over in other states is an issue, is because participants can take their stories directly to their fellow citizens without the filter of a reporter, and an editorial board and the myths that the oligarchy have been feeding the masses for decades are falling apart. (Trump calls this the system being rigged without explaining exactly how. He does need to be more explicit.) In former days, yes, the people had the vote, but the question really has always been who is counting the ballots, and this is no different. What 2016 has done and Colorado has exposed is that the will of the oligarchy prevails vote or no vote. Which begs the question, why bother letting people vote and maintaining the illusion that ones vote actually counts? Apologists for the party and the system will say, well these rules have been in place for XX years. Yes, but if the party chooses the nominee, why have popular votes? Thats the question that needs answering, as does why is this the nomination process in the first place. (And, yeah, its been this bad since before the Civil War if you really research it.) It is true that the American election system is convoluted. To be honest, that the people vote for president at all in a general election is a courtesy given by the states themselves. That office is technically elected by the state legislatures who then divide up their electors for the electoral college as they please. Winner take all is not necessary. We all understand that, as that process is open and transparent. It sits in the Constitution and after 700 attempts to get rid of it, it still sits there. Party oligarchies are a different story. The 100 different systems for party nominations arent law at all, just rules made up by a subjective group of people. They can be changed at any time, and they have been, usually to make the primary and caucus process spit out the desired candidate at the other end. The process is normally hammered out behind closed doors with little or no fanfare so as to not attract attention to the rigging, hence the label arcane. This is nothing more than machine politics, and at this time in history,with an educated accent. What has been pointed out is that this is dirty pool given that the people have been assured that their votes count. At the primary and caucus level, they dont. Which essentially means, that at the federal level of government, the people are shut out if they do not want to vote for any of the offered slate of candidates in office from the major parties. This may well be why such a small percentage of the electorate actually participates an advantage in machine politics where every vote really does count if the choices are equally bad. A smaller number of voters makes it easier to manipulate the system. What has prompted this years sandbox spat is that one candidate is actually talking about the issues Americans want to hear about for a change, unlike the offerings connected to the oligarchy, and challenges the way the oligarchy has been running, and ruining, the country. And the oligarchy doesnt like that. They are doing everything possible to shut the man up. He is pointing out how the nation is being raped and bankrupted, and how the people in charge are maintaining control. Thats what Colorado is all about. And that is what the people are coming to truly understand, and are revolting against. ",3
2,"YouTube Censors Sharyl Attkissons Full Measure Channel Time to put YouTube in the social media platforms to be used carefully category. Not that we didnt already know this, but this week Sharyl Attkisson, formerly of CBS news and now having her own online news outlet, Full Measure with Sharyl Attkisson, was informed that the content uploaded to the YouTube channel associated with her website violates community standards. Before too many people get their panties in a wad and their shorts in a bundle, it is worth remembering when it comes to social media that the majority of the platforms are either privately owned, or are publicly traded companies with boards of directors. The people that actually own these websites and services can set community standards for whatever they want. In the case of YouTube, the broadcast yourself site was purchased by Google in 2006. So, really, everything that is posted there is subject to the community standards Google decides they are going to impose on America this week. (Yes, they are all chums with the Obama White House, but so far, thats all hearsay and not admissible as evidence of collusion.) That being said, according to Ms. Attkisson, all she and her team did was post news stories done for her Full Measure outlet. All videos are posted to their website. Readers can visit Full Measure and judge the content for themselves as to whether or not their offerings violate what we could consider community standards or this is Googles way of controlling content available for public consumption. Naturally, there is quite an uproar over this move on social media, and that groundswell is covered most thoroughly at Twitchy. What is not made clear is which video was deemed to violate any sort of rules. Ms. Attkisson made a name for herself deeply investigating the scandals of the Obama Administration that the mainstream media refused to cover with any sort of integrity: Benghazi and Fast and Furious. A cursory glance at Full Measure indicates that with her own website, Ms. Attkisson continues this effort to the best of her ability in a way that all members of a free press should. Some of us may not like what she has to say or how she says it, but we will defend her right to do so on an open and free internet. YouTube, on the other hand, just like the rest of the content on the web, those who post are at the mercy of Google in a way. Not only do they control quite a number of platforms, but they set the standard for search engine criteria in their algorithms. Not much the rest of us can do about that but play along. By the way, Google is now owned by its holding company, Alphabet, Inc. For more information on who controls this massive conglomerate, see the Wikipedia page. Thank you for the kind words!

2,"University of California: Intolerance Will Not Be Tolerated By The Intolerant The cost of college education in the United States thats producing a whole generation of ignoramuses is skyrocketing and the Board of Regents at the University of California have, first and foremost, intolerance on the brain. The University of California is committed to protecting its bedrock values of respect, inclusion, and academic freedom. Free expression and the open exchange of ideas principles enshrined in our national and state Constitutions are part of the Universitys fiber. So, too, is tolerance, and University of California students, faculty, and staff must respect the dignity of each person within the UC community. Intolerance has no place at the University of California. We define intolerance as unwelcome conduct motivated by discrimination against, or hatred toward, other individuals or groups. It may take the form of acts of violence or intimidation, threats, harassment, hate speech, derogatory language reflecting stereotypes or prejudice, or inflammatory or derogatory use of culturally recognized symbols of hate, prejudice, or discrimination. Just out of curiosity, what would the Cal regents do with a Baptist and a Catholic arguing over the use of the Septuagint Old Testament vs. the Massorah? Oh, wait, they dont read the Bible? Yeah, never mind. So anyway, the people who themselves are rather intolerant of anything other than their own view of the world are now telling the faculty and students that they must be intolerant of intolerance. Everyones perspective is to be welcome and respected. No debate that might make someone feel bad about themselves or their convictions. So much for the university being a place to explore divergent ideas and have free and open conversation. So much for students and faculty first amendment rights as well. The Board of Regents atCal are demonstrating their tolerance for regulating speech which is in and of itself intolerance. However, this new set of principles goes further than that. Eugene Volokh offers reflection on this in The Washington Post: 1. The policy specifically condemns the expression of particular viewpoints as intolerant, as having no place at the University of California, and a violation of others rights to be free from expressions of intolerance. For instance, articulating a view that people with various intellectual disabilities are incapable of various intellectual tasks, or people with various physical disabilities are incapable of various physical tasks, would be condemned by the authority of the University. (University leaders will take all appropriate steps to implement the principles.) So, being not quite five feet tall, it is not permissible for someone atCal to offer to get a book for me off of a high shelf in the library? Well, gee, thanks a lot. And pointing out that abstract thought is not a great American virtue isnt permitted, eithereven if it is one of the base problems of our day. This is not Volokhs only observation on this move by the board of regents, but to tear apart the entire list would cut into too many other things. Ed Morrissey of HotAir has quite a bit more to say about it, but really, here we go again with reality imitating art. Ray Bradbury did not set out to publish guidelines on regulated speech. He meant Fahrenheit 451 as a warning of what happens when ideas are suppressed by force. And yet, it is happening before our eyes. At a university run on the public dime inCalifornia. You cant make this stuff up. ",3
2,"ObamaCare Bailouts Coming, Obama Promises To Dip Into Treasury Late on Friday, February 12, the night before Supreme Court Justice Antonin Scalia was found dead during a hunting party in Texas on Valentines Day weekend, buried deep in what the New York Post calls mind-numbing federal agency releases came one from the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) that stated $7.7 BILLION dollars would be available to reinsure the health insurers for money lost in trying to sell the pig in a poke known as ObamaCare: For the 2015 benefit year, HHS anticipates that it will have $7.7 billion in reinsurance contributions to be used for reinsurance payments. A careful reading of the actual document indicates that this is money collected actually for the express purpose of paying back health insurers losses that are stacking up for the private enterprise health insurance industry, and that the government doesnt have it all just yet, but SHOULD by the end of 2016, which is not exactly true. What seems to be the case, is that the Obama Administration is writing an IOU to the Treasury in order to keep a number of insurance companies from jumping ship when it comes to the Affordable Care Act. It is no secret that the insurers are losing money hand over fist on ObamaCare. And the administration wants to keep as many as possible in the fold. According to Modern Healthcare, this has to be the way it is because Republicans handcuffed the risk-corridor system during budget negotiations, and insisting that the risk corridors be budget neutral or paying for themselves. That happened in 2013 when no less than Senator Marco Rubio put a rider in the budget deal that took out the LEGAL bailouts of the health insurers. This from The Hillwas included in the story from November of 2015 on this topic: The angst in the industry centers on an obscure program in the healthcare law known as risk corridors that was designed to shield insurers against losses. Rubio in 2013 went on the warpath against the program, decrying it as a taxpayer bailout. He penned op-eds against it, testified about it as the star witness at a House Oversight Committee hearing and even made his case to top House Republicans including then-Speaker John Boehner (R-Ohio). There is a problem with the way [ObamaCare] exchanges are now designed that have not yet received the attention they deserve, but I promise youre going to be hearing a lot about it in the days to come, Rubio said in a Senate floor speech in early 2014. While Rubios attempt to scrap risk corridors altogether was unsuccessful, his push contributed to a policy rider that was inserted into a 1,603-page spending bill passed at the end of 2014. Under the provision, which is still in effect, the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) could no longer tap other accounts such as its overall appropriations or its Medicare funding to fund the risk corridors program. And so, to bail out the health insurance providers, the Obama Administration is making promises to pay against EXPECTED revenue, that, actually, the program is not entitled to. The New York Post explains: This is money you and everyone else who already has insurance are forced to pay, called a reinsurance fee. You pay the fee whether you buy your own plan or get covered at work, even if your employer self-insures. You may be clueless about it, but the fee is buried in your premium or taken out of your compensation. The text of the Affordable Care Act is clear as a bell on what this money can be used for. Some of these annual fees adding up to billions a year belong to the public, not the insurance companies. The law states a fixed share shall be deposited into the general fund of the Treasury of the United States and may not be used to offset insurance companies losses. Oops. Once again, Barack Obama and his merry band of executive orders harpies have been caught trying to go around Congress, and buried the information on what ended up being a wacked out news weekend loaded with distractions. After all they did it last year, why not try it again, right? ",3
2,"Ferguson October Update - Protesters Invade City Hall And The REALLY Rich Mall After the official protest in Ferguson at midday today when a few hundred people marched on the police department, dozens of young people gathered at the Soldiers War Memorial downtown, a monument to the fallen of World War II, and marched across a public park and Market Street to St. Louis City Hall. According to StLtoday and Fox 2 News, the protesters went through security one by one in order to chant slogans in the rotunda and draw attention to themselves. One person was arrested when he or she tried to hand a banner on an antique globe in the historic building. Meanwhile, twelve miles west on Highway 40, about 25 people stood in the center court at Plaza Frontenac, the area mall home to Saks Fifth Avenue, Neiman-Marcus, Coach, Williams Sonoma, Talbots, and all the other super-upscale chain stores. Participants said they belonged to a local group called Millennial Activists United. Alexis Templeton, one of the leaders, said of Frontenac, This is is a rich and aflluent area. We wanted to march here to bridge that distance from our situation. Jamell Spann, another organizer, said, We made people feel uncomfortable, but we want to show them how we feel uncomfortable every day. By turning yet ANOTHER mall into the one that white people used to go to? Gee thanks. It seems that the professional agitators are just getting warmed up. More details as they develop. ",1
2,"Nanny Bloomberg Targets Gun Owners Rights in Cowboy West - Bullseye on Nevada No place in America is beyond the reach of the crooked fascist finger of control-freak Michael Bloomberg and that includes the wide-open spaces of the American West. People live in the remote areas partially because they value independence and want to be free of people like Bloomberg, to be left alone to live their own lives free of the intrusive outsiders. Even though there arent a lot of humans in parts of the state, Bloomberg is out to make it more difficult for people to defend themselves wherever they are, whatever the threat. Nevada is dangerously close to California and many of their liberal ilk have relocated east, to Las Vegas and Reno, bringing with them their disdain for the Second Amendment. Nevada also has a large Hispanic population, so its ripe for Democrat socialist adventurism. Bloomberg is using his wealth nationally to impose his transformative vision of the United States, with eliminating the second amendment a primary focus. Progressives such as Bloomberg operate through the use incremental steps. A national gun registry is an important component in his assault on our gun rights. Through his front group, Everytown for Gun Safety, Bloomberg is supplying thefundingfor a gun control effort which seeks to require background checks for private firearm transfers, gun show sales and sales or gifting among family members. Thanks to Republican Governor Brian Sandovals veto, Nevadans were able to dodge a similar bullet in 2013. This new effort would put a gun registry bill on the ballot in 2016 in the form of an initiative asking the question: Should unlicensed firearms dealers be able to sell guns without running background checks? Many people will respond reflexively to that wording and support the measure, without considering the broader implications. Many voters arent thinkers and they are easily manipulated. The group being funded by Bloombergs front group is Nevada Network Against Domestic Violence, and they are active in all 17 Nevada counties. Susan Meuschke, their executive director, claims the push is not about creating a gun registry but that a registry would be a component in their gun safety effort. She says, Its about suicide and law enforcement and keeping guns away from dangerous folks. Gun control is always pitched to the public as a necessary and reasonable surrender of freedom in the name of safety. It is neither. While Meuschke admits there is no way to prevent criminals from getting their hands on guns, she falls back on the blanket if only one person is saved, it is worth it justification. Shes wrong; one person is not worth it. A more accurate application of that logic would be the opposite, if only one Constitution is saved, it is worth it. The very people sponsoring this effort are some of those from whom our Second Amendment is intended to offer us protection, Bloomberg and other tyrants, as well as the more common, albeit less affluent street criminals. The Second Amendment is a fundamental right that saves lives. Labeling that right as a threat is a familiar socialist tactic. It is a threat to their authoritarianism, not to the American public. It is our protection and we, in turn, must protect it.

2,"Top EPA Dirt And Air Worshiper Will No Longer Speak To Subhuman Climate Realists Now its official. If you dont admire emperor Obamas new clothes, his Air, Dir, and Water Nazi, Gina McCarthy, has decided you no longer are worthy of her time. According to her the discussion is finished, her side won, the fairy tale is real and those who insist on living in the real world, alarmism deniers, have now ceased to exist. Her boss, Hussein Obama has empowered the little witch through his own declaration that the science is settled. The EPA troll announced in a Facebook interview with Mashable on Tuesday, that shes done talking to climate deniers, displaying the typical open-mindedness that is so characteristic of the global government shills. In falsely presenting her case as being grounded in reason, McCarthy said, If they havent figured out by now, what in Gods name could anyone say to them? Conversely, one could ask the same questions of the dirt worshipers. She continued, I dont check out flat Earth society and Im not talking to climate deniers. Thats it. Sorry, I know Im supposed to be for everybody, but my patience has worn thin over eight years. Actually, McCarthy, nobody has ever accused an EPA chief of being for anybody other than the Democrat NWO, so dont worry your manly little head over it. Nobody has ever gotten a straight or honest answer from this manipulative subversive either, though shes had eight years of non-stop attacks on the American people and our nation in which to offer one. Were paying tax dollars to be dictated to, demeaned and have our country destroyed in the name of complete and utter lies, nonsense, idiocy and corruption. She thinks shes lost her patience? She attempts to defend her agencys war on coal, and the economic disasters that they have inflicted upon ordinary Americans. Although its something that Hussein Obama announced prior to his taking the office he now holds, McCarthy said, This is not something that happened over the past administration. While the Bush and Clinton administrations were no friends of the American people, to say that the damage has not increased exponentially under her and Obama would be a false statement on par with equating erosion with the the mythical rising sea levels. The Daily Caller notes that in a June 2015 speech, McCarthy stated that, normal people, not global warming skeptics, would win the climate debate. Of course normal people and global warming skeptics are one in the same. In fairness to McCarthy, she probably only associates herself with other Democrats and complicit establishment Republicans. Its hard to recognize anormal personwhen all you have is EPA sycophants as your points of reference. In that speech she also stated, I am doing that not to push back on climate deniers. (the normal folks) You can have fun doing that if you want, but Ive batted my head against the wall too many times and if the science already hasnt changed their mind it never will. The evidence of that head batting has been manifesting itself with increased frequency in the policies of the regime since they first hit town, in 2009. Were starting to have concerns for the walls under a constant barrage of such thick-headedness.

2,"Susan Rice - Globalism, Bribery To ISIS Better Than Defeating Them In War Susan Rice, Hussein Obamas National Security Advisor, is intimately involved in overseeing the day to day strategic and tactical foreign policy failures of the Obama regime. Shes micromanaging the growth of ISIS and played a significant role in the destabilization of Libya, assisting Obama and Clinton in turning it from a prosperous, stable nation with whom we had a working relationship, into a hotbed of terrorism and chaos. Based upon the quality of the results of her advice, maybe Rice should just be handed a Rubiks Cube and instructed to keep her hands busy and her mouth shut. With advice like hers, Obama might as well be winging it; not even he could do any worse on his own. In the private sector she would likely never have been hired in the first place and if she were, her tenure, and the associated damage which resulted, would have been limited. But she works for the federal government in the anti-American Obama regime; things are different. Failure, destruction and irresponsibility are rewarded. Instead of being brought up on charges, Rice is brought up on stage, giving a speech to young Air Force Cadets. They may or may not have the awareness to recognize the camel dung as it piles up on either side of the podium, but they are in the demographic targeted by the Marxist Sanders operatives, the same communist outfit that Obama and Rice work for. The liberal agitator and advocate of touchy-feely American weakness lectured cadets at the Air Force Academy on Thursday, poisoning their thinking with the politically correct drivel that American is trying to win the battle for hearts and minds against ISIS and that in order to defeat ISILs ideology for good, we must offer a more compelling vision. Rice is, like her boss, a blatant liar and a commie con artist who excels at babbling like an idiot. The terrorists arent bloodthirsty savages because the United States lacks a compelling vision. They are who they are because thats who they are. They lack, morals, moral character and humanity. They cant be salvaged, they can only be eradicated and not by coddling such as she prescribes. We need to defeat them by killing them. Shes vividly demonstrating how failing to recognize the enemy, to name the Islamic terrorist enemy, and to engage the enemy has led to a much more formidable and capable adversary. Rice said, We must demonstrate, as president Obama has said, that the future belongs to those who build, not those who destroy. That includes promoting sustainable development and economic opportunities. Sustainable development is the Marxist global redistribution of wealth under the UN global government already approved for implementation by 2030 by this White House. What Rice is telling the students, though they may not fully realize it, is that in order to stop terrorism, we must bribe the bad guys into not hurting us, by giving them our stuff. Its what might be called appeasement if it werent part of something much larger and more sinister. The treasonous leftist trash declared that, Ideologies are not defeated with guns; theyre defeated by better ideas. With that revelation in mind, we might ask Ms Dipstick if we put on our thinking caps and simply came up with a better idea than blowing people to shreds or cutting off their heads, if that would be enough to make the terrorists stop? Its a lack of better ideas that is causing all of this bloodshed? That shouldnt be too tough. How about not blowing people up or head chopping for starters? Brilliant in its simplicity isnt it? Did it work; have they gone back to their goats yet? Oh, you mean a better idea has to come attached to our money, property and assets. So the idea of not cutting off heads is a good one, but its incomplete. All we need to do is add a little extortion payment and its a foreign policy to build on. In the final analysis, its really Americas fault; were not thinking hard enough and havent opened our treasury to the pirates. Exhibiting the regimes belief that the United States is the worlds greatest problem, which has been their official position since the first apology tour and speech in Cairo in 2009, Rice said, Recognizing that the United States is not necessarily the best messenger, were working with partners across the globe, including in Saudi Arabia and Malaysia. After all, why win a war when you can engage in a long, drawn out, guaranteed to lose, submissive PR campaign which will allow ISIS to continue to grow exponentially while you pretend to fight the good fight? Is that part of that compelling vision of your, Ms Rice?

2,"The Zombie Apocalypse and the Decline of the Republic Apocalypticism has exploded in popularity and, while nuclear war and pandemics have always been a starting point, the concept of the Zombie Apocalypse trumps them all. The appeal and wild popularity of shows like The Walking Dead, movies like World War Z, and the slew of apocalyptic, gloom and doom series and specials on cable television continues to grow by leaps and bounds. But the reasonsbehind such interestare often subconscious at times and not fully understood. The Leftist activist and agitatorNoam Chomsky was recently asked why theres this preoccupation with the apocalypse and with zombies right now in our culture? I concurred with the first part of his response which was that he felt the focus on zombies was a reflection of fear and desperation by an unusually frightened country. But quickly the obsessive liberal impulse to blame America first and foremost for all ills, real and imagined including the publics obsession with a zombie apocalypse, rose irresistibly to the surface. He went through the history of fear in popular culture as outlined in the book War Stars by Bruce Franklin. Although the fear is embodied in various forms, he sees a common thread throughout: There are a couple of themes that run through it that are pretty striking. For one thing, one major theme in popular literature is that we are about to face destruction from some terrible, awesome enemy. And at the last-minute we are saved by a superhero or a super weapon, or in recent years high school kids going to the hills to chase away the Russians, things like that. Thats one theme that runs through constantly. And theres a sub-theme. It turns out this enemy, this horrible enemy thats about to destroy us, is somebody were crushing. I think its, much of it is kind of just a recognition, at some level of the psyche, that if youve got your boot on somebodys neck, theres something wrong. And that the people youre oppressing may rise up and defend themselves, and then youre in trouble. And another is strange properties the country has always had of fear of invented dangers. There is a kind of paranoid streak in the culture thats pretty unusual. And thats about the best the Left can do I guess in trying to fathom the countrys fascination with a Zombie Apocalypse. Its all just collective, subconscious guilt. Nice try, I suppose, but if that was a hit or miss explanation its far closer to a miss than a hit. There is indeed a vast undercurrent of suspicion, unease, paranoia, division, worry, pain, and even trauma right underneath the surface of the national consciousness. I believe it is manifested in the popularity of zombie themed entertainment and the concept of the doomsday scenario in general in popular culture. The feeling that things are rapidly unraveling and coming apart is a constant theme in social media and shared by vast swaths of the population, not to mention visualized in everything from backyard bunkers to Zombie apocalypse decals, Facebook groups, and bar crawls. Collectively, we have lost our belief in a positive future. The truth is that the American political system has been dysfunctional for decades and the country seems to have become functionally insane since the attacks on 9-11. The fears and rage unleashed that day has, in turn, unleashed a fast-growing and aggressive slew of government agencies, policies, and powers.Recent revelations have made us aware that the turn-key tyranny, 1984 surveillance state is upon us with every cell callmade and every internet email, photo, comment, and social media post recorded and sucked into gargantuan government databases for no discernible or reasonable reason that the average person can fathom. Two unpopular wars and the eventual election of the most intellectually bankrupt, corrupt, radical, and left-wing President in American history has only further divided an already deeply divided nation. Not since the Civil War has the nation been as polarized as it is now and the hatred that exists between the Right and the Left is real and palpable as each bitterly blames the others for every economic, societal, cultural, and policy ill that one can imagine. The once powerful Republic is basically bankrupt and the financial system living only on borrowed time and credit. And a myriad offederal agencies and vast numbers of the citizenry are frantically arming themselves and stocking up on ammunition in a frenzy that shows no sign of abating. The country increasingly has no sense of itself and is flooded with everything from vast hordes of illegal immigrants to bitter cynicism while the traditional pillars and institutions of the State and society are under unceasing attack from all sides. The once proud partners, logic and common sense, lay rotting in the gutter having been slain by our progressive comrades when they were perhaps most needed. ",3
2,"NO AUDIT: Pentagon Cant Account For $6.5 TRILLION Back in 1996, Congress passed a law that says all government agencies must conduct an annual audit. According to a new Office of Inspector General report IGs are supposed to be the people who provide unbiased oversight of government agencies the Department of Defence, i.e., The Pentagon, has not so far complied. As a result, the DoD has no idea where $6.5 trillion went. From Armstrong Economics: Once again, the office of Inspector General has come up with a huge hole in the Department of Defense with a missing $6.5 trillion. The day before 911, Rumsfeld admitted there was back then $2.3 trillion missing from the Defense Department budget. That has now grown to $6.5 trillion and counting. They have reported that the Office of the Assistant Secretary of the Army (Financial Management Comptroller) (OASA[FMC]) and the Defense Finance and Accounting Service Indianapolis (DFAS Indianapolis) did not adequately support $2.8 trillion in third quarter journal voucher (JV) adjustments and $6.5 trillion in yearend JV adjustments1 made to AGF data during FY 2015 financial statement compilation.2 The unsupported JV adjustments occurred because OASA(FMC) and DFAS Indianapolis did not prioritize correcting the system deficiencies that caused errors resulting in JV adjustments, and did not provide sufficient guidance for supporting systemgenerated adjustments. At this point, thanks to Armstrong, and the Financial Times, that the deficiencies in bean counting at the Pentagon have been known for at least fifteen years. Then DoD Secretary Donald Rumsfeld admitted it. However, in the succeeding years, nothing seems to have changed. In fact, the Pentagon actually had a person who just put numbers into the budget without being able to back them up for the Navy. According to a Reuters investigation: For two decades, the U.S. military has been unable to submit to an audit, flouting federal law and concealing waste and fraud totaling billions of dollars. Linda Woodford spent the last 15 years of her career inserting phony numbers in the U.S. Department of Defenses accounts. Every month until she retired in 2011, she says, the day came when the Navy would start dumping numbers on the Cleveland, Ohio DFAS. Using the data they received, Woodford and her fellow accountants there set about preparing monthly reports to square the Navys books with the U.S. Treasurys. And every month, they encountered the same problem. Numbers were missing. Numbers were clearly wrong. Numbers came with no explanation of how the money had been spent or which congressional appropriation it came from. In the real world, this lack of systemic competence in accounting would be grounds for firing. But then, in the real world, no one deals with trillions of dollars outside of big banks. The issue is not that the money was stolen or disappeared, but the spending was not documented properly. Congress has issued a directive to the Pentagon to have their finances in shape to be audited at the end of the 2017 fiscal year. Well see if the warriors know how to keep receipts. ",3

2,"Pot Smuggled Into U.S. In THESE! See to believe. Whats up, Doc? Evidently it the creativity level of Mexican drug dealers is. Forget tunnels and drone drops. Now they are hiding pot inside vegetables. Look out FDA! Sunday, Border Patrol agents confiscated over 1 ton of marijuana hidden inside fake carrots. Thats right, carrots. The Pharr-Reynosa International Bridge in Pharr, Texas is on a popular drug-trafficking route. That is where agents made the bust. When a tractor trailer carrying fresh carrots from Mexico into the United States was scanned, the imaging system flagged it for secondary inspection. Officers then examined the truck with canines. Mixed in with the real carrots they discovered 2,817 carrot-shaped packages stuffed full of pot. Two Border Patrol pick up trucks were brought in to remove the contraband. The haul filled the beds of both of them. The approximate street value of the marijuana the agents found is $499, 000. Port Director Efrain Solis Jr. stated Once again, drug smuggling organizations have demonstrated their creativity in attempting to smuggle large quantities of narcotics across the U.S./Mexico border. He went on to add Our officers are always ready to meet those challenges and remain vigilant towards any type of illicit activities. It turns out, hes right. This isnt the 1st time that his officers have prevented drugs from entering the country in this fashion. Near the end of 2015, Border Patrol agents confiscated nearly $2 million in cocaine and marijuana hidden in, you guessed it, carrots and even some cucumbers. That incident occurred at this same checkpoint at the Pharr-Reynosa International Bridge. According to the U.S. Customs and Border Patrol website, the agency seized 135,943 lbs of cocaine, 2,015 lbs of heroine, 4,330,475 of pot, and 6,135 lbs of meth in 2009 alone. Given our Presidents refusal to secure the Southern border, you can be sure that those numbers have gone up since then. 2016 Vianna Vaughan source: Fox News ",3
2,Judge Sides With IRS - Targeting Victims Cannot Hire Forensic Expert to Find Lost Emails ,3
2,"New IRS Abuse Tool: Civil Asset Forfeiture Act of 2000, Bankrupting American Small Business Owners In 2000, President Bill Clinton signed into law the Civil Asset Forfeiture Act. It was sold to the public as one tool in an arsenal for the War on Drugs. The idea was to seize the evidence counted as assets of drug offenders before they had a chance to hide them among friends and family. To this end, police can and do seize property and cash based on a preponderance of evidence that authorities claim is part of an investigation of a crime before any indictment or trial occurs. (Innocent until proven guilty is so unfashionable in the drug war.) Civil Asset Forfeiture has been famously abused by police departments across the nation since that time. Because the assets are forcibly seized and do not have to be returned in their entirety, the most popular targets have been cash and vehicles which are absorbed into department budgets or sold for the profit. (This is an abuse of power that needs to be amended as soon as possible in its own right.) One of the practices that law enforcement looks for when it comes to gathering evidence of drug crimes is something called structuring where drug dealers and other criminals make daily bank deposits between $5,000 and $9,999 in order to avoid the paper trail that deposits of $10,000 or more in personal accounts creates. It seems that every time a bank accepts a $10,000 deposit, there is a pile of regulatory paperwork to be filled out plus additional taxes. In order to avoid this, bank tellers and accountants tell every day business people who use their personal accounts for business purposes, to limit their deposits to under $9,999 per day. To law enforcement, this looks like preponderance of evidence of crime. And if it looks this way to police, it looks that way to the IRS as well. Below $10,000, deposits do not require an immediate tax payment. So, when a year or twos worth of deposits between $5,000 and $9,999 every day accumulates, the IRS begins to investigate, and seizes the assets sometimes life savings of small business owning Americans prior to any kind of charge, let alone a conviction. (Yes, this is a violation of 4th Amendment rights, but because the Civil Asset Forfeiture Act reads the way it does, the deposit trail is enough for a warrant and seizure of evidence.) By using the Civil Asset Forfeiture Act as the source of evidence to investigate, well, whatever crime the IRS seems to think is in progress, the most hated agency in the entire Federal Government is confiscating the savings of small business owning Americans at a rate 500 times higher in 2012 than 2005. (That figure can be found in this article from MSN.) Avoiding paying taxes any way we can is a great American tradition, but going after small business owners who have done nothing wrong and have no other evidence against them other than non- major asset level bank deposits is beyond unacceptable. And according to the MSN article, many of the victims of the IRS abuse give up pursuing getting their money back rather than go further into debt fighting. This story was particularly disturbing: In one Long Island case, the police submitted almost a years worth of daily deposits by a business [Bi-County owned by the Hirsch brothers], ranging from $5,550 to $9,910. The officer wrote in his warrant affidavit that based on his training and experience, the pattern is consistent with structuring. The government seized $447,000 from the business, a cash-intensive candy and cigarette distributor that has been run by one family for 27 years. [The attorney for the family]has argued that prosecutors violated a strict timeline laid out in the Civil Asset Forfeiture Reform Act, passed in 2000 to curb abuses. The office of the federal attorney for the Eastern District of New York said the laws timeline did not apply in this case. The federal attorneys office said that parties often voluntarily negotiated to avoid going to court, and that Joseph Potashnik, the Hirsches first lawyer, had been engaged in talks until just a few months ago. But Mr. Potashnik said he had spent that time trying, to no avail, to show that the brothers were innocent. They even paid a forensic accounting firm $25,000 to check the books. Bi-County has survived only because longtime vendors have extended credit one is owed almost $300,000, Mr. Hirsch said. Twice, the government has made settlement offers that would require the brothers to give up an excessive portion of the money, according to a new court filing. We werent going to take a settlement, because I was not guilty. No honest, hard-working business owner should ever have to tolerate this. As much consternation and vitriol was generated over the IRS refusing non-profit status to conservative political groups, using a law which may very well be illegal anyway to confiscate the hard earned money of honest and upright Americans deserves more scrutiny. Using the Civil Assets Forfeiture Act for IRS cases is plain and simply an abuse of power. Too bad the Obama Administration would never put a stop to it. ",3
2,"EPA the Green IRS - Garnishments, Attachments, Without Court Order Coming in September The continuous press for more power and control of the American people by the Obama regime continues, with one of its more egregious offenders announcing a new policy in the totalitarian march. The EPA is now claiming the authority to bypass courts and unilaterally, on their own, garnishpaychecksand attach assets of those it accuses of violating their rules. Senator John Barrasso (R-WY) opposes the power grab, saying, The EPA has a history of overreaching its authority. It seems like once again the EPA is trying to take power it doesnt have away from American citizens. Repeated efforts were made by The Washington Times to contact the EPA for an explanation as to why they feel it is necessary to be able to garnish peoples wages. In true tyrannical fashion, they ignored those requests. Last week The EPA made the announcement in the Federal Register, claiming that existing federal law allows it to garnish non-Federal wages to collect delinquent non-tax debts owed the United States without first obtaining a court order. They claimed authority is granted under the Debt Collection Improvement Act of 1996. That law provides every federal agency with the authority to conduct administrative wage garnishments, provided hearings are conducted in which debtors can challenge the amount of the debt or the terms of a repayment schedule. This action comes on the heels of new energy-killing coal regulations and an attempt by the EPA to obtain regulatory authority over virtually all land, public and private, through the manipulation of the water regulations as they pertain to water which may or may not even exist. The potential for casual water collection is enough to provide the premise for the EPA to intrude onto property, including that which is privately owned. This extension of their reach into the wallets, bank accounts and private property of any and every American citizens will truly create a monster capable of killing off what remnants this nation has of a free people. An example of their tyranny, which will compound exponentially if this is allowed to proceed, is the $75,000 fine and order to remove levied against a Wyoming man, Andy Johnson, for constructing a pond on his 40 acre property. This is an open door to tyranny, and their victims dont have to be polluters. The EPA is setting itself up to become an enforcement agency through which every aspect of American life can and will be controlled. Anyone who doubts the threat is real need only read the UNdocumenton Agenda 21 which was introduced into Congress by Nancy Pelosi and Implemented by the newly elected Bill Clinton in 1992. This is the continuation of a plan which has been in the works for a long time. There is absolutely no reason to acquire power they dont intend to use, and no doubt they will use it liberally.

2,"[Watch] Judge Jeanine - Border Crisis a Cover For Trafficking by Corrupt Governments and Cartels Judge Jeanine Pirro focuses an underreported aspect of the problem being created on our southern border and the issue of illegal immigration. The somewhat obscure problem is that of the human trafficking of young girls and boys who are being recruited, under duress, by violent gangs and cartels into the sex and drug trades. The judge breaks the problem into three different but related areas. There are the mothers who are running from traffickers voluntarily with their children. There are mothers using coyotes who then engage young girls as part of a sex trafficking operation. Thirdly, there are cartels bringing male children in to use in their drug trafficking operations. Her guest, Conchita Sarnoff of the Alliance to Rescue Victims of Trafficking says that things are rough in the Central American countries and the gangs and cartels are in charge. She says that the three primary offender countries, El Salvador, Guatemala and Honduras all are run by what are basically gang governments. The governments are affiliated with and run by the La Mara Salvatrucha, or MS-13, MS-18 transnational criminal gangs which have a membership in excess of 70,000. Sarnoff describes that in addition to the $9,000 average fee charged by the coyotes to transport the illegals across Mexico, the lucrative nature of trafficking means that the children are often also used for those purposes along the way. They become victims of a crime of opportunity created of desperation and a lack of consequences for their exploitation. Sarnoff says that for many, particularly those in less stable environments, there is a strong likelihood that they will remain in association with the gangs once they arrive in the United States.

2,"Robin Williams Had Serious Money Troubles in Months Before His Death Claims Friend- Was The Pressure Too Much? Scroll to the bottom for the police report Robin Williams tragic death at age 63 came as a shock to the world who knew him only as a lovable comic figure. But a source close to the Mrs. Doubtfire star tells RadarOnline.com that in addition to his addiction struggle, the actor recently confided to a family friend that he had serious money troubles, and was worried about his familys financial security. According to a family friend who had spoken to Williams recently, All he could talk about were serious money troubles. There were clearly other issues going on and Robin sounded distant during the telephone conversation. Robin was known for being so generous to his friends and family during the height of his success, and would help anyone out that needed it. There was also frustration that Robin expressed at having to take television and movie roles he didnt want to take, but had to for the paycheck, the source said, referencing his recently announced decision to film Mrs. Doubtfire 2. Doing sequels was never Robins thing, and he wasnt that excited at having to reprise the role of Mrs. Doubtfire, which was scheduled to start filming later this year. He also recently worked on Night at the Museum: Secret of the Tomb, the third installment in that franchise. In addition, Williams revealed in a Parade Magazine interview last year, that he took a role on the now-defunct CBS show The Crazy Ones because he needed the paycheck. The idea of having a steady job is appealing, Williams told reporters. There are bills to pay. My life has downsized, in a good way.

2,"Internet Giveaway Preview - Twitter Suspends Accounts For Criticizing Saudi Abuses The future of what will be the formerly free Internet is readily apparent in the censorship activities of its two social networking giants, both of whom are violating anti-trust laws. Laws dont matter if youre working for the globalists and the Obama regime. So they arent being broken up, theyre being given free rein, and abusing that power. Personally, this writers Twitter account was locked out yesterday with no reason given, something Ive experienced before. I received only a vague promise that theyd look at the situation in a few days if I was lucky and until then its locked. I cant talk to anyone about it and they could not possibly care less. Thats the infamous Twitter support and customer service at its finest. My account, @RickRWells, with 25.4K followers started the previous day with 25.8 before being locked out. My punishment for a subjective and still unknown infraction of the twitter gods dictates was a penalty imposed of four hundred followers being simply removed from my account. It doesnt matter that those people chose to be there and want my communications, theyre insignificant peasants. What is important is the egos and agendas of those in power, censors are neither reasonable or nice people. Twitter censors are the worst kind of tyrannical liberals. With the upcoming attempt by Hussein Obama to give Americas Internet over to his globalist cronies at the end of the month, its another action of the Twitter thought police that accentuates the reason all Americans should be concerned. We should all be demanding that our supposed representatives in Congress be doing whatever it takes to prevent the international thugs from having the very real ability to silence us at will. The Saudi Arabian Female Empowerment (S.A.F.E.) movement, an organization critical of Saudi Arabias treatment of women as slaves, was suspended and soon followed by others who were using the #StopEnslavingSaudiWomen hashtag. The hashtag had started to attract attention, trending on Tuesday. It is an attempt to protest the saudi treatment of women, a position that seems unpopular with the number two owner of Twitter, a Saudi prince. Naturally the response of this tyrant was to stamp out their rebellion, to step on them just as he does at home. Americans should understand that we are being given a preview into just how our ability to interact with others will be impacted by a foreign Internet takeover. These Saudis have bought control of a company and with it that portion of our speech. Imagine what they and other tyrants will be able to do with the full control of the Internet that Hussein Obama is giving to them. The possibilities are, unfortunately, limited only by our imaginations. Thankfully Breitbart reported this attack on our basic rights as Americans as Ive been locked out of my account by the same censors and am unable to investigate firsthand. Thats how it works in the new global Amerika. Freedom is something we pretend to still have as the tyrants in control wrest it out of our grasp.

2,"Castro Impressed by Pope, Said He Might Return to Catholic Faith Cuban President Raul Castro said he was so impressed with Pope Francis hemight return to the Catholic Church, The Associated Press reported at a meeting Sunday, May 10, of the two leaders. Pope Francis had a role in helping normalize relations between Cuba and the United States, a fact Castro said he appreciated. The pope plans to visit Cuba on his way to America in September. After leaving the Vatican, Castro, the brother of Fidel, the revolutionary leader who brought the Communists to power in Cuba, praised the pope At a news conference with Italian Prime Minister Matteo Renzi, Castro said he came out of the meeting with the pope really impressed by his wisdom and his modesty, Reuters reported. When the pope comes to Cuba in September, I promise to go to all his masses and I will be happy to do so, he said, adding that he reads all of the speeches of Latin Americas first pope, who has made defense of the poor a major plank of his papacy. I told the prime minister if the pope continues to talk as he does, sooner or later I will start praying again and return to the Catholic Church, and I am not kidding, he said. Both of the Castro brothers were baptized as Catholics. The pontiff is a Jesuit, and I, in some way, am too, AP reported Castro saying. I always studied at Jesuit schools. Castro is the leader of a Communist country that has cracked downon dissidents in the past,drawing criticism fromthe Vatican. I am from the Cuban Communist Party, that doesnt allow [religious] believers, but now we are allowing it, its an important step, Castro said. Atheism is atraditionalplank of communism, which drew its inspiration and philosophy from Karl Marx, who called religion the opium of the people. The normalization of relationsbetween Cuba and the U.S. has been a controversial move by the Barack Obama administration, with some lawmakers wondering what America will gain from the move. Others say a thaw in political and economic relations between the two nations is long overdue because the longstanding hostility between the nations hasnt forced any changes in Cuban repression of dissidents. And itremains to be seen if Castro will make good on his promise to allow religious freedom. If religious liberty is permitted, can other natural rights to life, liberty and property be far behind?

2,"Operation Stampede Busts MASSIVE Food Stamp Fraud Scheme It always starts with good intentions. In the case of a massive food stamp fraud scheme outside of Miami in Florida, the good intention was letting those receiving Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP) benefits, aka food stamps, purchase fresh fruits and vegetables at open farmers markets. The problem: a number of vendors in the Opa-locka Hialeah Flea Market were willing to swipe the EBT cards of the benefit recipients and, for a cut of the cash, dole out dollars rather than actually selling any produce to the customer. These retailers are flagrantly abusing the public trust by stealing millions of dollars from the federal food stamp program that is intended to provide low-income households with their needed basic provisions of food and nutrition, [Wifredo A. Ferrer, the U.S. attorney for the Southern District of Florida, said Wednesday.] When all was said and done in the flea market raid that happened earlier this week, 22 people were charged with fifteen being arrested in relation cases of known food stamp fraud that cost the government and tax payers $2.4 million that was intended to help keep the poor nourished with fresh foods. A list of the defendants can be found at the Miami Herald. Throughout South Florida, Ferrer claims that there is even more abuse to the tune of $13 million traced in questionable EBT card transactions, thus prompting the claim that the raid earlier in the week was the largest food stamp fraud bust in U.S. history. Jack Heacock, director of the Florida Division of Public Assistance Fraud, said the arrests were only the beginning. Those people who received the money will likely be sanctioned, he said. The defendants, all of whom were authorized to accept food stamps, face charges of wire fraud, conspiracy to commit wire fraud and food stamp/EBT fraud, according to the indictments. The fresh food outlet additions were an attempt to address a growing problem in the inner cities and poor areas of the country where access to fresh foods is scarce. These parts of town are known in the hunger relief industry as food deserts, where the local food marketis more likely to be the convenience section of a gas station than a grocer. Despite the skepticism of outlets such as Judicial Watch, these areas do exist, and the lack of availability of fresh, healthy foods does effect the health and well being of the poor, or in politically correct terminology, food insecure. (Dont forget, we end up paying for this via medicaid sooner or later.) The EBT card expansion was a flawed plan at best to deal with this issue, but outright fraud in cashing in the cards with the cooperation of the vendor is something else entirely. Video of the raid can be seen at MiamiHerald.com. ",3
2,"The Poor Mans SHTF Rifle The Mosin Nagant is the ultimate poor mans rifle for a WROL (Without Rule Of Law) or SHTF (Excrement Hits The Fan) scenario or situation. They are among the cheapest rifles one can purchase and yet are a very effective weapon that delivers a great bang for the buck. They saw frontline service for decades and appeared in dozens of conflicts the world over including both world wars. They were designed to be simple and hardy weapons and served the vast peasant armies of Russian effectively. Some seventeen million of these rifles were produced and that has assured that their ready availability and low price continues even up to today. But even their once incredibly low prices have started to climb and now are starting to approach the $150 mark. The main thing going for the Mosin Nagant is its still relatively low price and simplicity of use. It is extremely easy to maintain and use. It gives its wielder a powerful weapon that can reach out and touch someone and provides a long-range option as well as necessary. It is equally up to the task of punching through body armor or walls. Perch on top of your buildings roof during a WROL event and you would be able to dominate a large area with effective fire and protect a wide swath of territory from marauders, rioting mobs, or armed gangs systematically going house to house through a neighborhood or looting a business district. Lets be honest, a fully functional historical rifle made famous by the movie Enemy At The Gates makes a great addition to any collection, an excellent wall trophy conversation piece, and a good back up in any SHTF scenario. Obviously, a win, win, win situation. There are still many out there fresh from our old cold war enemy and, undoubtedly, a few of them responsible for the death of a Hitler henchman or two. And claiming a Commie weapon for the cause of the average American patriot if always worthy of praise. It shoots an impressively powerful round, because you never know when someone may be hiding behind something. You reach out and touch someone with that and they are definitely done for the day. Many people utilize Mosin Nagants as cheap backup, trunk, or hand out guns in case of a WROL event. You cant ask for a better gun to cache somewhere along your bug out route or stash in the basement at your bug out location at grandmas house in the country. It is not pretty and is heavy, loud, and kind of clunky with no effective safety. But for those on a very tight budget this is a rifle worth looking at. Needed accessories include a gel stock pad which greatly cuts down on recoil while lengthening the stock for more comfortable shooting. This reduces the Mosins infamous kick to a far more manageable push. Id also suggest you pick up an SKS chest bandolier that can securely carry about 100 loose rounds for your Mosin or you can can get an original issue ammo pouch that will hold either loose or stripper clipped rounds. Personally, I avoid the clips and prefer the SKS bandolier for the ease in carrying a significant amount of loose 7.6254 rounds. You can also purchase ammunition online as even this caliber is being swept off the shelves as soon as it appears. You can purchase 440 rounds of Bulgarian military surplus rounds for about $120 including shipping. A shorter carbine version (M44) is also available but it is becoming harder to find and delivers more of a kick than the longer, standard version (M91/30). Altogether, for under $300 you can have a good WROL rifle and enough ammunition to fight a small war. For the money (outside of a used pump 12 gauge shotgun) this cant be beat. It is also legal in even the most restrictive of states and municipalities. If you can get and afford a semi-auto then I encourage you to get one. But if a tight budget or other constraints dictate something else, then the Mosin Nagant is worthy of your consideration for a SHTF situation. It is every mans duty to be able to protect his family, community, and nation and every citizens duty to exercise the Bill of Rights. If you dont own a firearm, go out and buy one today. Part of being an American is exercising every single right you have. Remember you are a free and sovereign citizen, not a servant, serf, subject, or slave. Act like it. Now, more than ever, Americans need to avail themselves of their Second Amendment rights. A review of the Mosin Nagant (not by me) ARVE Error: Element ID could not be build, please report this bug. What a WROL event can look like ARVE Error: Element ID could not be build, please report this bug. Some people REALLY get into the Mosin Nagant and there are numerous tribute videos on youtube to the rifle. ARVE Error: Element ID could not be build, please report this bug.

2,"Medical Establishment Slow To Admit Limiting Carbs And Eating Natural Fats Help Us Lose Weight Somewhere around 1950, an American physician posited that because physicians were seeing so many arteries clogged with cholesterol, it must be true that dietary fat causes heart disease, obesity and all that goes with it. The medical establishment spent the next few decades trying to prove it and that cranks, quacks and outliers like Dr. Robert Atkins who insisted that it was the carbs making us fat, not the dietary fat (like the people of previous centuries knew) were just, well, wrong. After a year-long study was concluded and the results published in September of research that was supposed to prove once and for all that low-fat diets were the way to go and fat was the medical equivalent of Satan members of the medical establishment, the sorts who have set themselves up as experts, are beginning to admit that natural dietary fat just isnt the health evil they made it out to be. The medical establishment got it wrong, says cardiologist Dennis Goodman, director ofIntegrative Medicine at New York Medical Associates. The belief system didnt pan out.The idea that fat kills got so ingrained, it became folklore. Your mother told you, your grandmother told you. Its going to take years to get people to believe that was wrong, he says. Were in a transition, and on the cutting edge. It may take a while, but youll see new guidelines. It seems that this latest study piles on the evidence that has been building for over a decade clinical trials are proving that low-carb diets greatly improve Framingham Risk Calculator scores that indicate the risk for heart related trouble down the road. Blood pressure drops, the small particle cholesterol (bad cholesterol) lowers, good cholesterol is raised, and fat is burned off rather than lean muscle mass. All are good things. While the evidence seems to be overwhelming, since there are no precise percentages as to what the ideal diet ratio of fat vs. carbs as yet in the medical literature, it seems that doctors are slow to actually change their recommendations to patients. We no longer think low-fat diets are the answer, says Dr. Linda Van Horn of the AHA Nutrition Committee. But, she says, the AHA still recommends keeping saturated fat below 6 percent of total daily calories, or half what the low-carb dieters consumed in the NIH study. There just havent been any controlled clinical trials yet showing us how much saturated fat is safe, Van Horn says. There also havent been low-carb clinical trials running long enough to reach hard end points heart attack, stroke, or death. That means no one can say with certainty that a high-fat diet will make you live longer. That might be why so few doctors recommend them. Isnt there this thing in the Hippocratic Oath about doing no harm? Living longer is one thing. Enjoying that life by eating tasty food thats full of natural fats is even better. In the meantime, one study after another is vindicating Dr. Robert Atkins, Gary Taubes and the others who all insist that avoiding dietary fat is a big, fat lie.

2,"Obama Sends Marines to South Sudan President Obama has once again embarked on a legacy building mission by sending the U.S. military to South Sudan. An administration spokesperson said today that it has sent 40 additional soldiers toSouthSudans capital, Juba, to help secure American personnel and facilities in the war-torn city. Currently there is a tense cease-fire in place between opposing factions which has held since Monday night. The additional U.S. troops were deployed at the request of the State Department, said Africom spokeswoman Cpt. Jennifer Dyrcz. Secretary of State John Kerrys office was contacted for comment but they declined. Over the last five days of fighting in the capital President Salva Kiirs forces ousted those loyal to First Vice President Riek Machar from one of their bases. Meanwhile, sources inside the capitol. The fighting has left hundreds dead in the capital and aid workers said bodies are littering the streets. The U.S. Embassy in Juba said it is organizing flights to evacuate non-essential staff and for all U.S. citizens wishing to leaveSouthSudan. Commercial flights to Juba remain cancelled though charter flights are evacuating hundreds of aid workers and other foreign citizens from the capital. The U.N. said 36,000 South Sudanese civilians have fled their homes due to the fighting, taking shelter in churches, U.N. bases and aid workers compounds. There is hardly any food in the market, and people are starving. As a result, they are turning to coping mechanisms like looting to survive, said Jeremiah Young, policy adviser for World Vision. Many aid workers cannot get to desperate civilians because of the continued insecurity. There are reports of government soldiers blocking aid workers from moving to areas where civilians need assistance. Relief workers should be given freedom of movement, said We urgently call on all concerned to guarantee safe and unhindered access for humanitarian organizations to ensure that we are able to reach all people in need, including in locations hardest-hit by the fighting.

2,"Bill Melinda Gates Fund Gun Control Initiative, While Living With Armed Guards... OLYMPIA, Wash. (AP) Microsoft co-founder Bill Gates and his wife, Melinda, have donated $1 million to a Washington state campaign seeking to expand gun control measures in Washington state, bringing their coffers up to nearly $6 million dollars. The measure would require background checks for all gun sales and transfers in Washington state,including at gun shows and for private sales. In a joint written statement issued Monday, the couple said that they believe I-594 will be an effective and balanced approach to improving gun safety in our state by closing existing loopholes for background checks. The large donation comes on the heels of fellow Microsoft co-founder Paul Allens $500,000 donation earlier this month. Also last week, venture capitalist Nick Hanauer donated an additional $1 million, bring his total donation to the campaign to nearly $1.4 million. Other prominent figures who have made large donations to the campaign include former Microsoft CEO Steve Ballmer and his wife, Connie, who have given $580,000. Agun rightscampaign, Initiative 591, would prevent the state from adopting background-check laws that go beyond the national standard, which requires the checks for sales by licensed dealers but not for purchases from private sellers. That campaign has raised just over $1 million so far. We need another operating system to take over the industry. Bill Gates sucks. I wont give him another dime. Ill be loading Linux on my systems from here on out. This, from the guy who gave us the Blue Screen Of Death. Priceless. Well, they made a mess of education with the common core. These people need to find some real world people to learn from. Youd think with all those billions that Bill could get a decent haircut(snicker) Headlines usually speak a lot about the subject. They didnt have to write it like he was for gun control but then hid behind armed guards. Sorry, thought this would get the attention of people that were against child porn and abuse and would assume that Bill Gates would work on something that he knew about rather than poke his nose in to something that he actually uses to defend himself with but wants none of us to. No, actually I love it when I can piss off someone that wants to do harm to children and if I offended you then good for me. When did it become his internet? He has no say in what the internet does. He developed Microsoft Explorer, not the internet. LOL!! Tim, there are no peasants or serfs in the USA. We are all equal under the law. Gates and his ilk have decided that they know what is best for all of us. They can kiss my battle scarred butt. I will never submit to gun control nor will any of my family and friends. Your main point is valid, however. Has anyone just stopped and thought about how much crime on children alone has been accomplished by his internet? But he wants to take guns away from good people along with the bad while hiding behind guns. This is the only contribution he does for America evidently while following suit with obama and helping other countries more. And just what is wrong with your law abiding neighbors exercising their right to keep and bear arms? Dont any of you ever read an article before you start yacking your ignorant jaws. What he is supporting is less background checking and no background checks on private sales. So you he man woman haters need to go back and read the article, you probably support the same thing he does. Who does these people think they are?? And do they really think people are this stupid!! Here they giving money for gun control yet they have all these guards plus whosever in the house working for them probably has guns!!!! What hypocrites!!! So, surely for the big massive people that believes in having guns are they helping the NRA etc. that is behind every AMERICAN owning a gun!! If I had that much that these people have for gun control I would match theirs and then some for no gun control and give to NRA, etc. and Bloomberg we all know the man is so scared to go home by hisself that no telling how many people he has guarding him!!! If stupid in public was a law, a lot of peeps would be down the road. Including some of those commenting here! Whats their stake in Washington? Do any of them even live there? Libturd hypocrass, Ive never met a gun with a mental problem!! SCREW YOU GATES! And the rest of you Hollyweed holier than thou Thats where there is a misconception you see. They arent anti gun, they just dont want YOU to have one. Kind of like Germany in the late 30s early 40s. Police officers jobs ARE NOT to protect people, it is to arrest people. Their guns are NOT to protect the public but to protect themselves. A police officer does NOT know the law, the ONLY laws they know are traffic laws, except when they happen to get lucky and actually arrest someone whom they THINK MAYBE breaking a law, in most cases they are NOT even sure there has been a law broken, it is left up to a Judge to decide if a law was indeed broken. Then the officer can say to himself ah ha it is against the law, now I know at least one law that I can arrest people for. I wonder if Bill Gates even knows that not a single gun on earth has ever killed anybody or even wounded anybody ?? Guns are not dangerous, People are and I think Bill Gates is a people ! Gates, stay out of politics and education. Two things you dont have experience in. Just because you have the most money doesnt make you wise. Im sure that Mr Gates has armed body guards, which he approves of but because he has lots of money, he would have legal citizens be disarmed and unprotected? Youll never pass a law that will disarm criminals. They will always find weapons. He needs to take his money and use it to help insure that our country is never attacked from with in by helping eliminating the socialistic Democratic Party. When you have an open boarder, that allows criminals in from everywhere in the world and you think that when they arrive here in the USA, that they arent going to continue their criminal ways, you are as blind and ignorant as the Democrats have been, by allowing them free access to our country. No other country in the world allow criminals to simply come in and set up shop. We are in for attack from with in and no gun laws are going to stop that from happening. The only hope we have is for legal gun owners to be able to defend themselves Bill Gates has never done anything for America , except suck all the dollars he can out of it , his gifts all ways goes to foreign country,s, the country would be much better off if he went to live with ISIS I wonder how many of those who donated have armed body guards for themselves and families, just wondering if they would give them up. You are spot on!! Gaylan, a responsible individual with a gun is not like a thug packing heat! These laws are not going go stop the thug from getting a gun! They will stop the responsible individual that go through proper channels to get a gun! So they can protect themselves and their families from the thug that went to the street to obtain theirs, to rob you me or anyone else even worse kill! If you get held at gun point hold up the law on.paper!. They will lay down the weapon and walk away. If that dont work hope one of your neighbors packing heat shows up! He probably uses Bing and cant find it *sarcasm lol* Pretty sure its been proven that gangstas mostly kill each other. And again, I said MOSTLY So poor people who cant afford cops. Too bad for them, huh? Let me share with you something about your neighbors. Theyre packing heat anyway. MONEY JUST CANT CURE STUPID. THIS GUY IS RIGHT ON THE STUMP WITH OBAMA. Yes! I would hire professionals. We have Chicago thugs who retired here in the south. They are expert killers. They have body disposal skills as well. Many of the cops used to work for them back in the day. Great plan Bill and Melinda. Hire criminals to carry weapons and prevent good citizens from messing up the criminal employment plan. The elite hire the criminal element and leave the rest of us to rot in the mess they created with their money. Dont fall for these rich thugs and their hire an armed thug plan. Bill Gates needs to Google the Constitution. Self Defense is a natural human right. Its just as OK for a person of the peasant/serf to own a firearm as it is for a multi-billionaire to have hired armed guards. Bill Gates and your wife, what a pair of assholes eat up with a bad case of the DUMBASS,.. Bill said that. Genius, is not always all its cracked up to be. Just like their funding medical research on children in 3rd world countries behind the evil mask of doing good for the less fortunate Just another rich, liberal tool!~! Please leave this country. It is for free people only! So when someone else carries a gun to protect you, that is good. Thanks for wiping your ass with the Constitution by believing it is only for the %1. I hope their Armed guards fall asleep on the job and some nut case caps both of them! Hypocrite. If you are against guns, get rid of your armed guards. There are too many laws now. Enforce them and no more will be needed!! Gates needs to stick to something he knows about and get out of his Utopian existence and learn some facts. Guns arent the problem, degenerates are. The argument most definitely works. He wants to be protected. He can afford to hire an armed guard for protection because hes too big of a sissy to protect himself. But he wants to take that right from everyone else. There are far too many firearm regulations as it is. Get lost you POS. Glad to see that you believe that their lives are more important than your own. No.. gangstas only kill innocent white people. FUCK OFF YOU RETARD!!!!! Ex cops re some of the most mentally unstable people on the planet! Allowing them to even OWN a firearm is a mistake! Look at how many cops kill UNARMED CITIZENS every year? In Seattle there is usually at least one murder of an unarmed citizen by a cop every year and you believe those psychotic bastards should be allowed to have guns??? OH HELL NO! waste of their money gun control is not negotiable it is a right of every law abiding citizen. The headline to this piece is trying to make an argument that doesnt work. It is not inconsistent to want gun control on a broad scale but hire armed guards for protection. Professionals who are hired for protection are often former police officers, and protecting people is their profession. Thats not at all the same as all my neighbors packing heat. And crazy, well off people frm yall own demograohic culture keep fucking up people. Mass shootings killing kids. Gangstas dont do tht shit. And ones that do get what they deserve eventually. But raking gunz away from good people thay Magic have a record, wow. How are they suppose to protect their families Both of the evil scum bags would do the world more good in BODY BAGS!!!!!

He knows its quite pointless for him to be spending his time talking to EPA Chief Gina McCarthy but its the process, one that needs to change. Oversight and the opportunity to air the dictators side of the story are part of the equation, with little in the final results reflecting the wishes and the interests of the American people. Our economic engine must be turned off and that means our manufacturing must go, both by moving it offshore as well as by putting American industry out of business. Eliminate the fuel and the factories cant run. The industry and jobs go elsewhere and America is crippled, weakened and ultimately destroyed. Its not that tough to figure out. McKinley pleads with the little white-headed unisex witch anyway, informing her that China is going to be increasing their use of coal by 460 gigawatts of power and India by another 360 gigawatts. He points to the fact that other countries arent joining the United States in committing economic and political suicide, saying, I dont know what its going to take, the worlds not following our leadership. He reminds McCarthy that Two or three years ago I raised this same question and you were going to get back to me and I never heard back from you again. He asks the same question more or less, saying, According to the IPCC with the United Nations, if we terminated all coal-fired power plants, ended, so we didnt burn one ton of coal in America, the total reduction of CO2 on the globe would only be two-tenths of one percent. Do you think thats a measurable impact on the climate of the world? Especially given that the other nations arent going to follow, so that if we terminate two-tenths but yet the other nations of China and India are going to way more than make up for that loss its worth it to our economy, to put all of our people and our coal companies out of work, for something thats not measurable? She doesnt care, Congressman. Of course its beyond foolish, but shes got an excuse, some philosophical line of crap shes creating especially for you. McCarthy responded by playing dumb and innocent, saying, I am not looking at make any choices on the kinds of energy that are generated, a complete and total lie as her clean power regulations clearly prove. She says, Im really trying to keep my eye on my job, which is to try to reduce pollution in ways that are reasonable. Carbon Dioxide is not pollution and putting our industry and forty percent of our energy supply out of operation in no way resembles anything close to reasonable. Her Humble Nazi approach is a ploy to disarm her opposition and maybe inspire them to go a little easier on her, nothing more. McKinley addresses the war on coal and the administrations decision to place one third of coal reserves off limits. He plays her Chicken Little climate game to make his point, saying, I dont understand, if it doesnt have an impact on climate change around the world, why are we subjecting our hard working taxpayers, men and women in the coal fields, to something that has no benefit? McCarthy doesnt handle facts or exposure well. Faced with both she offers a feeble attempt to justify the Green Tyranny, saying, We see it as having had enormous benefit in showing sort of domestic leadership as well as garnering support around the country for the agreement we reached in Paris. She admits the benefit is one of propaganda and brainwashing, and she considers that to be of enormous importance. McKinley stays on her, hitting back with the real world counter-arguments. He says, No ones following it, and adds, Since that Paris accord, Chinas already announced that theyre going to put up 360. Indias announced that theyre going to double their use of coal, since the Paris accord. It almost looks like our EPA is owned by China or India and is their means of securing a steady supply of coal that otherwise would have been wasted fueling American industry. In other questioning, Rep. John Shimkus (R-IL), chairman of the House Energy and Commerce Subcommittee on Environment and the Economy told her, By cutting EPAs budget and reducing its staff levels, our intent is that youll refocus your limited resources toward implementing and enforcing congressionally authorized core missions and policies. We want you to do your job no more, no less. House Appropriations Chairman Hal Rogers (R-KY) advised McCarthy that the EPA will not receive the $50 million they requested in its fiscal 2017 budget in order to implement the Clean Power Plan mandates. Rep. Ed Whitfield (R-Ky.), chairman of the Energy and Power Subcommittee, told McCarthy there is real angst over the Clean Power Plan. He pledge that his committee would be aggressive in making sure the agency was following the Supreme Courts ruling, saying, We are going to do everything we can do to do serious oversight to make sure that the stay issued by the Supreme Court is followed. It seems the voters may have their representatives attention, at least in the short term, until November.

2,"Ted Cruz Anointed For End Times Transfer Of Wealth - Dad Says Now Is The Time In promoting his 7 Mountains Strategy, dominionist Rev Rafael Cruz says, The wealth of the wicked is stored for the righteous. And it is through the kings, anointed to take dominion, that that transfer of wealth is going to occur. Of course those wicked he describes are whatever non-believers his group chooses to identify and the recipient of the wealth will be the good people in his church. The other preacher, in this video from late 2011, declares that In a few weeks it will be the very first day of the spiritual year. Itll be the spiritual year of the year 2012, not January but in a few weeks, 2012. The number 12 means divine government, that God will being to rule and reign. Not Wall St, not Washington, Gods people and his kingdom will begin to rule and reign. He says, I know thats why God got Raphaels son elected. Ted Cruz, the next Senator. But heres the exciting thing and thats why I know its timely for him to teach this and bring this anointing. He says that In a few weeks begins that year in 2012 and that this will be begin what we call the end times transfer of wealth. Who better to have on your side as youre scheming a wealth transfer than the president of the United States? He addedthat when the Gentiles begin to receive this blessing, or the property of others that is being transferred, they will never go back financially through the valley again, they will grow and grow and grow. Cruz raises his hand at that point as if to take credit for their upcoming Jackpot. The preacher gets even more into the religion for profit weeds saying that God is looking at the church and everyone in it and deciding in the next three and a half years, who will be his bankers. Being a banker for God ought to pay pretty well, though who knew God needed moneyuntil now, his credit should be good. He then attaches being a trustworthy banker for God over the next 3 years to ushering in the Messiah. Is that Rafaels boy Teddy? He then says, This message is for you, would you welcome our good friend, Raphael Cruz. It certainly sounds like thats who he was talking about. Rafael proceeds to clear things up or further muddle them more, depending upon how you interpret his remarks. Hemakes his wealth of the wicked is stored for the righteous commentsand then says, There are some of you, as a matter of fact, I would dare to say the majority of you, that your anointing is not an anointing as priests. Its an anointing as king. And God has given you an anointing to go to the battlefield. And whats the battlefield? The battlefield is the marketplace. To go to the marketplace and occupy the land. Thats clear as mud so far, Rafael, please continue. To go to the marketplace and take dominion. He explains that is not just dominion over the church, but following in the footsteps of Adam and Eve, its every area. Cruz names a few of the seven, society, education, government and economics. But there is a second anointing and its the anointing of kings; kings who are anointed for a totally different reason than priests. Kings who are anointed to take dominion; kings who are anointed to go to war, win the war and bring the spoils of war to the priests. So the work of the kingdom of God could be accomplished. The preacher joins him again shortly so they can remind the congregation that its end times transfer of wealth time and that they wont be waiting 3 years, theyre getting started. His Bible has a lot more versus and elements to it than any Bible Ive ever owned or read. Who knew we were instructed to make war on the entire world and take all of their stuff, bringing it back to Rafael and the boys? This is the religion Ted Cruz was raised in and told on a daily basis by this guy that he was the chosen one, the anointed one to lead this takeover. Thats the best reason out there, even better than making America Great Again, to vote for Donald Trump. The Cruz family is dangerous.

2,"CATHOLIC FACEPALM: Soros $650,000 To Influence Pope Francis The DCLeaks release of emails related to George Soros bankrolled non-profits is getting painful. Now, were finding out that His Holiness, Pope Francis, was a target via his friend Cardinal Rodriguez being lobbied by think tanks that should be investigated for heresy. From The Daily Caller: The document is an agenda for a May 2015 New York meeting of the U.S programs division of the Open Society Foundations. It states that it had allocated $650,000 for a grant related to Pope Francis September 2015 visit to the United States. In order to seize this moment, we will support PICOs organizing activities to engage the Pope on economic and racial justice issues, including using the influence of Cardinal Rodriguez, the Popes senior advisor, and sending a delegation to visit the Vatican in the spring or summer to allow him to hear directly from low-income Catholics in America, the document states. The document goes on to state, The grant will also support FPLs media, framing, and public opinion activities, including conducting a poll to demonstrate that Catholic voters are responsive to the Popes focus on income inequality, and earning media coverage that drives the message that being pro-family requires addressing growing inequality. Where have we heard this before? PICO and FPL are both organizations that deal on the social justice side of religious activism. Faith in Public Life is a Catholic organization and PICO non-denominational. Both groups received grants from Soros Open Society Foundation and carried out the mission as their grants entailed. [FPLs]website states they carried out the functions of the Soros grant. In preparation for the popes visit to the US, we commissioned extensive opinion research about how Catholics respond to the Popes prophetic messages and released the poll at the National Press Club, FPLs site states. Throughout the trip, FPL coordinated messaging among numerous Catholic groups and did extensive media outreach. The Soros document goes on to state: By harnessing the Papal visit to lift up the Popes searing critique of what he calls an economy of exclusion and inequality and his dismissal of trickle down theories, PICO and FPL will work to build a bridge to a larger conversation about bread-and-butter economic concerns and shift national paradigms and priorities in the run-up to the 2016 presidential campaign. Which is the globalist way of saying, yeah, who cares about what Pope Leo XIII said about the free market and workers dignity. It is no easy matter to define the relative rights and mutual duties of the rich and of the poor, of capital and of labor. And the danger lies in this, that crafty agitators are intent on making use of these differences of opinion to pervert mens judgments and to stir up the people to revolt. Rerum Novarum, May 15, 1891 WE WANT SOCIALISM! This kind of talk has been going on in the Catholic Church for decades. It started on this side of the pond in New York with converts and some French from the old country who were guilt-ridden over being members of the haves. Being social activists prior to conversion, those people were trained and influenced by the early 20th century social commentator American writers, and knew how to couch their message for the sort of impact described by Leo XIII above. The movement was dismissed by one of the New York bishops as a communist plot in its infancy, but, like so many other movements that were rebuffed by popes since Leo XIII in the late 19th century, sooner or later the inequality meme was going to fall on fertile ears. Well, in the back to basics Pope, Francis, we have a leader who doesnt simply eschew protocol, hes clueless on economics, too. It was the opening the one worlders have been waiting for since Pope Saint Piux X sent John D. Rockefeller, Jr., packing when the young one worlder asked the Pontiff to relax the Churchs teaching on birth control, an event that has been conveniently scrubbed from the internet. (As a response, in 1907 Piux X wrote an encyclical titled On Modernism that condemned the doctrines of modernists. Put on an asbestos suit before reading it.) Piux Xs words could be applied today: the fact that the partisans of error are to be sought not only among the Churchs open enemies; they lie hid, a thing to be deeply deplored and feared, in her very bosom and heart, and are the more mischievous, the less conspicuously they appear. We allude, Venerable Brethren, to many who belong to the Catholic laity, nay, and this is far more lamentable, to the ranks of the priesthood itself, who, feigning a love for the Church, lacking the firm protection of philosophy and theology, nay more, thoroughly imbued with the poisonous doctrines taught by the enemies of the Church, and lost to all sense of modesty, vaunt themselves as reformers of the Church; and, forming more boldly into line of attack, assail all that is most sacred in the work of Christ, not sparing even the person of the Divine Redeemer, whom, with sacrilegious daring, they reduce to a simple, mere man. Back to the DCLeaks report, not too be too judgemental since the actual Soros grants were not made to the Church or any of her dioceses, but to think tank groups seeking to influence public opinion (as if many of us Catholics havent read encyclicals, the Summa Theologica, the Catechism and the Bible side by side even if a lot of priests preach as if they havent), the influence these groups may have had on His Holiness during his visit to the United States would have been more in the form of reinforcement of his convictions that were honed by years of watching what happened in Argentina, and the bankrupting of that country by capitalists who were really thieves by another name. This is what the man knows, and this is what Soros behind the curtain sought to exploit. And this is what makes so many of us Catholics FACEPALM with a vengance. It is unclear how many of the Church are willing to recognize a wolf in sheeps clothing. It happens in the pews, from the pulpits, and everywhere in between. And what makes it all so maddening, is that Catholics are actually taught to deeply consider all sides of an argument before espousing a side. So, Soros sought to influence the Pope. Hes not the first and he wont be the last. What makes it hard to swallow is that at every turn, once the dust settles and the media is no longer paying attention, this pope sticks with the program. Hes done it on marriage, transexualism, life issues, and a lot more. How much influence he allowed by lobbyists in this specific case will be amazingly hard to determine. On the topics they discussed, all that would have reached him would have been a reinforcement of his own opinion. And, yes, folks, opinion is fallible. ",3
2,"Texas Sellout Sen Cornyn Supports Open Borders, Globalist Takeover of US Establishment tool and anti-American traitor, Senator John Cornyn (R-TX), made himself a prop in his open borders message after becoming an expert on the situation during a Tuesday boat ride on the Rio Grande. Not surprisingly, the globalist said that walls and fences dont work; the answer is a virtual fence, the equivalent of virtually doing nothing. A virtual fence is what compliments our minimal current structures, and theyre often in poor repair, unmanned, and a series of gaping holes. Cornyn and his global government puppet masters are happy with America being virtually overrun by anyone who cares to saunter in. We can remember during the hard sell of anti-American TPP, Senator Cornyn standing with his fellow sellouts of their nation, Orrin Hatch (R-UT), Mitch McConnell (R-KY) and John Thune (R-SD). Weve been told innumerable times that a fence or wall wouldnt work. The reason walls surround prisons and the Vatican is precisely because that is a lie. They work extremely well, so well in fact, that the globalists have to oppose them as they interfere with their plans. Cornyn told reporters, Its more than just a physical obstacle. What we need is a virtual border. Actually, Cornyn, what we need is a Congress that isnt populated by self-serving whores to Marxist puppet masters willing to sell themselves and their nation for personal enrichment. Those people would have given us a secure border long ago. Asked about a border wall, Cornyn responded with his scripted message, Its more than just a physical obstacle. Its people. Its the boots on the ground and its the technology. He and his comrades are in the majority, why arent those boots and technology in place already? Do we just wait, defenseless until a real Congress that will act in our interests is somehow accidentally elected? He continued, pretending that our current immigration system, if properly enforced, would still be insufficient, saying, an orderly immigration system is the best answer to the problems along the border. Congress doing their job and forcing the executive branch to do theirs would be the answer to that problem and Cornyns party is in power in both chambers right now. Its his fault, as well as his criminal comrades, which is by and large everyone other than Senator Jeff Sessions, who are to blame. The only thing wrong with our system is that it is being allowed to be violated. Hussein Obama should have been impeached and still should, as should anti-American DHS Secretary Jeh Johnson. The establishment politicians, like Bush tool Cornyn are the reasons why nothing is being done, and a virtual system of defense is a euphemism for business as usual. His fellow traitor embraced the illegal aliens in his statement. Senator Cassidy, said Good people working on behalf of our country, sometimes on behalf of those who are not of our country but we are showing our countrys values as we work. Obviously hes got a problem with formulating sentences, but the message is clear illegal aliens shouldnt be prevented from wandering in if they feel like it; theyre Americans by virtue of their work ethic. Is this guy nuts, stupid, just a despicable traitor, or all of the above? The piece of open borders Senate trash put a red, white and blue bow on his hefty bag of globalist crap, saying, Never forgetting that we have to secure our borders. Never forgetting that there are laws to be followed, but doing it the American way, and an American way that makes us proud. Right now that way that is so American to this duo of criminal alien enablers is to ignore the laws and be obstacles themselves to every effort to secure our nation. Pretty, patriotic words dont disguise the reality. Joining the two sellout senators on their trip were: Mission, Texas Mayor Norberto Beto Salinas, McAllen Mayor Jim Darling, Hidalgo Mayor Martin Cepeda, and Chief Patrol Agent Manuel Padilla of the U.S. Customs and Border Protection agency. Its a group of local business and Chamber of Commerce mouthpieces with a CBP guy thrown in for the sake of the appearance of legitimacy and a security perspective. One of those open border parasites, McAllen Mayor Jim Darling, said, Sen. Cornyn is really a true friend of the Valley who understands our uniqueness and understands that the river behind us is not just the border. Its the drinking water for almost 3.2 million people, its irrigation water for tens of thousands of acres of agriculture on both sides of the border. He understands that a safe border is not a closed border. Does this idiot think the river is going to run dry if a wall or fence is built? Does he really believe that open borders are safer than secured ones? Of course not, nobody is that stupid; hes speaking through his wallet on behalf of his controllers. Labeling Cornyn a true friend of the valley is a recognition that he is not doing his job as a United States Senator, that hes looking the other way on border security and will continue to support lawlessness and open borders.

2,"Clueless Obama Shoves Solar Power Agenda on Alaska Town that Barely Gets Sunlight! OverpassForAmerica reports: President Obama promoted solar energy to residents of Kotzebue, an Alaskan town located 26 miles north of the Arctic Circle that gets less than six hours of sunlight for 34 days in early December through early January. I know you guys have started putting up solar panels and wind turbines around Kotzebue. And because energy costs are pretty severe up here, for remote Alaskan communities, one of the biggest problems is high energy costs, the president said in a speech he delivered during a three-day tour of the state in which he stressed the dangers of climate change.One of the reasons I came up here is to really focus on what is probably the biggest challenge our planet faces. If theres one thing that threatens opportunity and prosperity for everybody, wherever we live, its the threat of achanging climatewere transitioning away from energy that creates the carbon thats warming the planet and threatening our health and our environment, and were going all in on clean, renewable energy sources like wind and solar. Speaking of Solar Power Obama. Lets look at the condition of SUNLIGHT IN KOTZEBUE ALASKA! 1) This melting glacier you keep pandering to the sheeple about, as a causality of industrialized pollutionyeah, that has been receding since well before 1850.

2,"Wheres The Beef? Youre Not Going To Believe The New Record High Price With apologies to Wendys Hamburgers and that mayoral candidate in New York City, forget the rent. The price of ground beef is just too darn high. Over $4 per pound. The average price of a pound of ground beef climbed to another record high $4.235 per pound in the United States in January, according to data released by the Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS). The CNS News article quoted did not specify the fat content of said beef, so there is no indication of it being ground chuck vs. ground sirloin, but given the low price compared to what this writer has seen in the grocery stores lately, it has to have a high fat content. (Which is nasty to work with after its been frozen. But, since this is what is available during meat sales.) The price of beef has been rising steadily for a number of years now, a by-product of droughts in cattle country and some really dumb court decisions allowing precious irrigation water to be used to save the endangered Delta Smelt, essentially a minnow used for bait. (My fisherman cousins stomp on minnows if they find them in a lake.) Check out the pain at the grocery scanner we Americans have been experiencing. Given the economic conditions of ranching these days, it is most understandable that so many in the business have either given up or reduced their herds to a start over stock, but this staple of healthy living and nutrition no matter what the government has to say, is really putting a crimp in buying power. The price of hamburger has risen 19%. The end of the age of Obama cant happen soon enough. ",3
2,"Holder Surrenders Fast And Furious Documents To Congress The Night Before The Election Leave it up to Eric Holder to bury the story on his giving in to Congress. On Monday, the day before the most hotly contended and anticipated midterm election in the last few decades, the Justice Department delivered over 64,000 documents related to Fast and Furious, the code name given to a highly illegal gun running operation from Federal American sources to drug cartels across the southern border into Mexico, to the House Oversight and Government Reform Committee and its chairman, Rep. Darrell Issa. While this is a partial fulfillment of the request Congress made of the Justice Department, the documents in question are those that were deemed to be covered under Executive Privilege previously. From National Review: This production is nonetheless a victory for the legislative branch, a victory for transparency, and a victory for efforts to check Executive Branch power, Issasaid of the release. The document dump represents the Justice Department fulfilling a court order to produce evidence pursuant to discovery of the obstruction charge leveled against Eric Holder. At least partially. When Eric Holder wants to know why he was the first Attorney General held in criminal contempt of Congress, he can read the judges order that compelled the production of 64,280 pages that he and President Obama illegitimately and illegally withheld from Congress, Issa said. Since these pages still do not represent the entire universe of the documents the House of Representatives is seeking related to the Justice Departments cover-up of the botched gun-walking scandal that contributed to the death of a Border Patrol agent, our court case will continue. Thank you, Mr. Issa, for your dogged pursuit in this matter. Now, when can we expect the Darrell Issa show to resume with Holder in the hot seat to answer questions of what took so long? cover up by paper blizzard send everything and mix in a lot of bullshit to fillout the boxes Definitely should be in jail, I am sure he redacted any incriminating files just like the IRS Lerner did on her scandal Holder is a crminal he should be thrown in jail.

2,"Gun Control Cant Work If No One Complies Washington State Police were just watching as citizens violated a very unpopular stategun-control law that nobody seems to understand. Between 1,000 and 2,000 in a recent rally bucked the law by carrying weapons openly and transferred them as police arrested no one. In fact, law enforcement officials are privately highly critical of the law, which was passed with funds from liberal billionaires Michael Bloomberg and Michael Gates. If money talks, but no listens, is there a conversation? The law is an 18-page quagmire of jumbled legalese and unenforceable garbage and the state Attorney General has thrown-up his hands in desperation and has now tasked local law enforcement to do their best in enforcing this law that confuses even legal authorities, says Greg Campbell of theTea Party News Network. I-594 was approved by voters in November. The law prohibits private sales of firearms, except to immediate family, and involves government in the transaction, but at the same time the law expects those inheriting handguns to report to the state. As with New Yorks gun law that is being protested, sometimes ignored, and in litigation, the Washington legislation was passed in a rush. But everyone in authority there is passing the buck on what the law means and how it is to be enforced, and, of course, the buck stops at the police. The law does nothing to prohibit criminals and jihadists from buying or exchanging guns but penalizes the law-abiding gun ownerbecause obviously the intent of such laws are to disarm the public. Campbell points out the craziness of the situation: The state Attorney Generals office has released a statement, saying, Therefore, at this point we have no interpretations of the initiative to offer to the public beyond the text of the measure itself. Local law enforcement and local prosecutors typically enforce and prosecute firearms laws. For those who do not speak baffled lawyer, allow me to translate: This law is an absolute mess and practically unenforceable; so, I now ask local law enforcement to, you know, just do the best you can and make up the law as you go along. The Vancouver Police Department has a statement on its webpage referring readers to the Department of Licensing. The Seattle Police Department has not weighed in on the law. The prosecutor and sheriff of Lewis County have said they will not enforce the law. F**k em if no one complies they cant do shit BRAVO people STAND UP FOR YOUR RIGHTS. ",3

Every 65 minutes a military veteran in this country takes their own life. Thats correct. Soldiers! With numbers this large, the media should be all over it, right? Wrong. This is one statistic that is being swept under the rug. The Tactical 2200 is trying to change that. The 2200s Main Objective is to raise awareness about The 22, the vets who end their own lives daily. The intention is to cause a stir and gain attention by traveling across the U.S as a convoy of up to 100, particularly noticeable, vehicles. From the site: The Tactical 2200 is a Rally across The U.S comprised of Tactical Trucks, Lifted Trucks, Pre-Runners, Exotics and any other type of Crazy or Interesting Vehicle that will make a statement! Organizers wanted an event that would combine FUN with raising awareness for this important cause. Its not a race, but there are timed checkpoints and prizes awarded. Anyone who wants to take part can contact The Tactical 2200 for details. If youre one of the many who cant participate in the rally, but would love to support the cause, they have decals available. You can always help just by spreading the word about the event on social media. Veteran suicides are on the rise and few want to talk about it. The White House will not be arranging a press conference on this topic with anybodys parents by the Presidents side. No short-haired women on MSNBC will be ranting about this injustice. Leo Sher, MD has published and article in which he states In military veterans, depression, posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD), and suicidal thoughts are common and closely linked. Veterans are less likely to seek care and more likely to act successfully on suicidal thoughts. 22 suicides a day is an insane number.You can join the Tactical 2200 in bringing it to ZERO.

2,"[Watch] Lois Lerners Lost Emails - How Convenient, Too Convenient The Fox All Stars Panel open the segment with Congressman Jason Chaffetz voicing his opinion that the emails they seek from Lois Lerners office havent fallen off the end of the earth. Theyre out there, he says, They just dont want us to have them. The supposed hard drive crash which lost the two years worth of emails is reported by the regime as occurring in 2011. The panel, like most people capable of rational thought, isnt buying the story. Charles Krauthammer starts things off by stating that people hes talked to, who have a computer expertise, tell him that any data lost in such a manner would be absolutely recoverable. He also reminds us that the second article of impeachment against Richard Nixon was one which accused him of abuse of the IRS to pursue political enemies. Krauthammer says plainly, this is a high crime. Ron Fourier of the National Journal describes the statement/denial by White House spokesman Josh Earnest as being insulting to his intelligence and really making him angry. He says for until proven otherwise, we have to presume a cover-up. George Will shares that sentiment and says he has one question for the IRS. How many computers crashed back then?

2,"The Ancient Evil Religion Of Political Correctness With quiet dignity a hooded figure revealed himself from the protective ring of trees. Mounting a small hillock he faced the sea of expectant faces. A measured sweep of his hands pulled back the hood to reveal a wizened face framed by a long white beard. For a long moment not a sound was heard or movement evident in the crowd. The robed figure examined the myriad of faces before him with watery blue eyes that shone with intelligence and understanding. What he saw before him was hope. Hope on faces that only hours before had expressed only despair and fear. Their faces were still haggard but fire now dwelled in eyes that had previously only contained the spent ashes of surrender. His grey cloak marked his as one of the Wise Ones; dedicated to preserving knowledge from the past so that humanity would not have to relive it. Tonight he would be reading a selection from The Chronicles of Chaos. The hushed gathering listened with an intense reverence as the old one began to read from the ancient scroll. At the beginning of the Twenty First century a new religion rose to great acclaim and with much fervor. Its followers worshiped an all-powerful god named Political Correctness and a host of minor deities including Diversity, Tolerance, Sensitivity and Inclusion. Its priests were called Professors and they were charged with passing on its teachings to the youth and guarding its most holy of secrets. Collectively, this priesthood was called Academia and they resided in their own communities called Universities. Sustained by the public treasury their power grew and their prestige spread like a swarm of locusts upon the earth. The elite of the every generation would be turned over to the Professors to be indoctrinated into the new religion. It was at the Universities that the young were taught to despise the old ways and to reject the teachings of their parents. The old traditions, cultures, holidays, religious practices, and beliefs were reviled, trampled and belittled so that they could be replaced in the minds of the young with the new teachings of the new religion. After their period of indoctrination and training the new prostheletizers of Political Correctness would be sent forth to spread its doctrine far and wide. The fearsome deities of Political Correctness were bloodthirsty and constantly demanded sacrifices to sate their Perpetual Outrage. The lives, careers, reputations and power of countless individuals were sacrificed to appease the ever angry gods and eventually all but a brave or foolish few were forced to acknowledge their supremacy. Their power and influence was everywhere and all feared to say what they truly thought or felt for fear of the great retribution of their fanatical followers. A single word uttered in carelessness or a stray thought out of context was enough for one to be summoned to judgment before those charged with satisfying the never-ending lusts of Political Correctness. The minor deities also were a dark and foreboding force that had to be appeased. Many were followers of the feminine Right to Choose cult and untold millions of the unborn were sacrificed in an orgy of infanticide on the blood splattered altar of Convenience. The deviant and the perverse demanded, and eventually received, the sacrifice of the once sacred institution of marriage to appease the demands of Equality. And the followers of the high priest Gore and the god Gaea demanded the rejection and reversal of the evil Industrialization. No longer would the Creator be worshiped but only the Creation and isms of Political Correctness. So it was said, and so it was done. With the growth of the religion of Political Correctness came the persecution of the followers of the One True religion. He who born of a virgin, nailed on a cross and known as the Messiah, Savior and King by his followers was banned from the schools and the public square. Increasingly, his followers were forced to cower behind their church doors as their dwindling leaders were toppled by scandal, arrested and punished for hate speech, or cowed by the new religion. Many of this priestly class of the Old Religion became converts of Political Correctness and even taught its doctrine in their houses of worship. There are those who believe that the religion of Political Correctness was derived from the horrendous worship of the dark god Marxism whose victims had numbered in the hundreds of millions before he was cast out of the great temple of ideology and his followers mocked and discredited. But their last adherents had been among the Professors and many believed the worship of Multiculturalism, Diversity and Tolerance was merely the disguised worship of Marxism, resurfacing in another form. We may never know the truth. The Wise One stopped reading and lowered the scroll in his hand. Let us never forget what happened, and may we never repeat it. In the end the righteous were cast down and evil was called good and good was called evil. Every knee was forced to bow and every tongue confess that there was no longer right or wrong, only different, and that the right to not be offended was the greatest right of all. He looked up at the crowd and said, that is all for tonight, we will read more from The Chronicles tomorrow. Reverently he rolled the scroll back up and put it carefully into its resting place. Tomorrow the sun would rise again, and with it would come hope that man might once again know logic and common sense, tradition and virtue, morals and values, self-control and self-restraint. Perhaps once again man would realize that he was not merely a slave or an animal or a mindless drone but a builder of great civilizations and capable of great deeds Only time would tell if it was too late to reverse the cataclysmic results of the Before or if the faint hope for the scattered remnant that remained in the After could ever be fulfilled. Only the Wise Ones, the Sages of Old, still said there was a chance for humanity to redeem itself. Maybe, but just maybe, that would be enough.The Wise One motioned for the crowd to rise to its feet and together they solemnly chanted the mantra of hope that bound them together and showed the way for the future: Learn from the Past or we are doomed to repeat it. Learn from the Past or we are doomed to repeat it. Learn from the Past or we are doomed to repeat it. He needs to be removed right now if not sooner. In a nutshell, it is the communist way of silencing dissent as they destabilize and dismantle society. ",1
2,"Facebook Tag = Jail? This is not a Hoax. You have the right to use Facebook. Anything you tag can, and will, be used against you in a court of law. Thats the case for a New York woman namedMaria Gonzalez. Herformer sister-in-law,Maribel Calderon, was granted an order of protection against Gonzalez. In the order, Mariawasrestricted from having any contact, whatsoever, with Maribel. Maria apparently, did not understand that this applied toFacebook. She proceeded to tag Maribel Calderon in a post that referred to her as stupid. She has since tried to argue that the protection orderdid not specifically prohibit [her] from Facebook communication. Too bad for Maria thatWestchester County Supreme Court Justice Susan Capeci doesnt agree with her on the subject.The order of protection prohibited the defendant from contacting the protected party by electronic or any other means, the judgestated. Now Maria Gonzalez could be serving a year in jail for violating the protection order. Shes sure to get plenty of likes and pokes if she ends up there. It has been a busy week for law enforcement and Facebook. Tuesday,Donald Chip Pugh from Lima, Ohio was arrested in Florida after sending a selfie to the Lima police because he thought his mug shot on their Facebook page looked terrible. Maybe ancestry.com can tell us if these 2 are related somewhere. It would explain a lot. Since it appears that both Maria Gonzalez and Donald Pugh are going to have a lot of time on their hands, maybe they can better themselves with one of the many online education programs available to inmates. They have already shown a propensity for computers, so, why not? Perhaps they can even check out a copy of Blogging and Social Media For Dummies from the prison library. That way (provided they dont behave in a stupid or terrible manner while incarcerated)they can keep from winding up back behind bars. 2016 Vianna Vaughan source: Fox news ",3
2,"NO JOKE! Government Wastes 43 MILLION of Our Tax Dollars On A Gas Station! A Watchdog of the Department of Defense discovered inside criminal activity related to government contractors, and found a grossmisuse of U.S. tax dollars. The contractors took and spent43 to 47 million dollars to build a gas station in Afghanistan. A gas station that normally costs 500,000 dollars to build. A Task Force for Stability and Business Operations is at the issue ofinvestigation by the lead oversight team. These overseers monitor financial accountability of DODs task force contractors and their ongoing shenanigans of criminal operations being found on our dime. Whats truly outrageous is that the government agency that caught this hasnt been given any answers. This task force, dismissed in March of 2015 , cant locate and ask one contractor any questions related to this foul play. The Pentagons response is also negligent and cant give answers to who, what, where and how the contractors got away with all the tax dollar money. No one knows where the 43 million dollars went. Can anybody tell me how this happens over and over again? No one in Obamas Administration suffered any consequences for lostbail out money, Solandra, 2,000 Humvees given away or the Fast N Furious scandal. Unbelivable! Everyone he hired to head an important department of government has gotten away with theft, crime, money laundering, embezzlement, lies and the list goes on and on. Its colossal waste and down right dirty. Unfortunately, protests and phone calls dont change this misuse. Government has expanded and we the people get lost in the shuffleor shunned. Before the election, we MUST get the word of government waste and corruption out there to the people. We have unlimited examples of corruptionto give when speaking to our fellow Americans. 43 million dollars for a gas station?? By the way, The gas station isnt even being used related to security fears. So, it was built for NOTHING with OUR TAX MONEY!! ",3
2,"Al Gore Doesnt Get BIG Problem With Global Warming Causing Louisiana Floods Anytime a dire weather related natural disaster happens, Al Gore appears and blames it on Global Warming. That mantra repeated itself in Louisiana this week as floods have swamped the low lands of Baton Rouge, Louisiana. What is most likely the worst complication of massive weather systems up here in the rest of the Mississippi River Valley coupled with their own storms, according to Al Gore, is all mans fault. These kinds of record downpours thats one of the manifestations of the climate crisis, Gore said. It is central to the prospects for our future, for the futures of our families and our communities, and the future of human civilization, he said. That sounds overly expansive but that really and truly is the case. For the sake of Als sanity we will refrain from reminding him that a Category 3 or higher hurricane has NOT hit the continental United States since 2005, Katrina being the second to last of them. Such storms were supposed to get bigger and more powerful with global warming. Oops. The problem with Al Gores claims this time around is that current research doesnt demonstrate any such correlation. So, the next time you read that such and such extreme precipitation event was made worse by global warming, youll know that there is precious little actual science to back that up, Patrick Michaels and Chip Knappenberger, climate scientists at the libertarian Cato Institute, wrote in a blog post. Michaels and Knappenberger pointed to two new studies suggesting that attributing heavy precipitation events in the United States to human-caused climate change is a fools errand. A new study by University of Iowa researchers found the stronger storms are not getting stronger, but a larger number of heavy precipitation events have been observed. But researchers couldnt attribute such events to man-made warming, instead they wrote the climate variability of both the Atlantic and Pacific Oceans can exert a large control on the precipitation frequency and magnitude over the contiguous USA. Along with solar activity that seems to be decreasing, could the reality just be that we are in a natural cycle somewhere and it just happens that the skies are producing more precipitation? The earth is billions of years old, and we know from quite a bit of geological, archaeological and other evidence that it has been through multiple temperature changes over its existence. We also know that volcanic eruptions cause havoc with natural weather systems. None of that is the doing of man. And yet, according to the environmentalist nuts, its all mans fault. Thats not going to help get the gators out of the streets of Baton Rouge. ",3

2,"Internet User Privacy On The Line With New Proposal In another case of While Americans Were Distracted, the people who run the internets naming system, Internet Corporation for Assigned Names and Numbers (ICANN) quietly opened for comment what they are calling a minor proposal that would allow those searching for information on site owners to by-pass the proxies set up to protect identities and get a hold of confidential information without a court order. Individuals and businesses are currently allowed to hide their identity, physical location and other personal contact information behind proxies in the public WHOIS directory that stores information online about the owners of every registered website domain name. Proxies can be used by anyone registering a domain, from a lawmaker gearing up for a presidential run who does not want to tip off the press, to a blogger posting unpopular views online. The proxy service comes standard with many of the major domainregistrarslike GoDaddy. What the proposal will do is eliminate proxies for commercial enterprises. And that has a lot of internet companies, and those with a stake in the traditional anonymity of online activities, uneasy about what this new rule could mean. Critics of the potential change argue commercial activity will be impossible to define in a way that does not sweep up many other vulnerable populations that rely on anonymity. It will curb economic activity by adding untenable risk to using a website to promote ones business or to collect donations, and may even add this risk to hosting ads, according to comments by the Electronic Frontier Foundation and dozens of other groups. According to a widely published piece, what prompted this rule proposal was actually a concern over piracy. This change is being pushed by US entertainment companies, who told Congress in March that privacy for domain registration should be allowed only in limited circumstances. These and other companies want new tools to discover the identities of website owners whom they want to accuse of copyright and trademark infringement, preferably without a court order. Not that there is anything wrong with entertainment companies suing internet pirates for the royalties of their copyrighted material, but since they have the money to afford lawyers, they should request subpoenas just like everyone else. Their request is fine for their industry, but in other walks of life, to leave anonymous commenters and bloggers open to real threats on their lives and livelihoods presents a right to privacy quandary. How much privacy should the owners of public information domains have? It is a complex question that will require time and honesty to work through. What is encouraging about concern over this rule is that internet libertarians took to their email lists and circulated a letter asking their followers to comment to ICANN about the proposal as the period of public comment allows. Over 11,000 people took advantage, when most things ICANN proposes see next to nothing during the comment period. The fight is not over and the government agency with loose control over the matter is being coy about the rules purpose and effect, but if nothing else, those 11,000 people got ICANN to understand that even in the midst of damage done by the Supreme Court and drum beats to erase an entire time period from history, someone is always watching.

2,"The Original, Right-Wing Extremist One can reasonably presume how the Left would characterize and attack the person I am about to describe to you. Without a doubt, he would be characterized as some sort of dangerous, right-wing, tea-bagging, homophobic, Christian Neanderthal who should be maligned, attacked, marginalized, silenced, and driven from power. Character assassination has become the weapon of choice for those who so forcefully peddle the liberal/progressive ideology. It is relentlessly used to silence all those who stand in opposition to the myriad of isms they champion as they seek to fundamentally transform the country and society. I sincerely doubt they would spare him. He was the commanding General of the Army and later a two-term president. Unwavering and dedicated, he had a deep-set of personal beliefs and never faltered from his chosen path. He called morality a necessary spring of popular government and while in command of the army he ordered vice and immorality of every kind discouraged. Accustomed to undertaking daily devotions, he ordered worship for the army every Sunday and had twenty thousand Bibles imported for the troops. He even had the audacity to state to the distinguished character of Patriot, it should be our highest glory to add the more distinguished character of Christian. Can you imagine how those who worship at the altar of the separation of church and state would react to such actions and utterances? He was devoted and married to the same woman his entire life and appears to have never fallen for the temptation of affairs or mistresses during his marriage. His army was probably the first in history to not have a large corp of camp followers filled with harlots and trollops following in its wake. He firmly forbade looting of any kind and quickly drummed out of the army those caught engaging in sodomy. He was a staunch defender of the right individual to keep and bear arms. He declared that a free people ought to be armed and never challenged or questioned the right of individuals to privately own the most advanced firearms of the day. So who was this man who championed such principles that stand in such stark contrast to modern-day liberals and Progressives? His name was George Washington. Discipline, honor, principle, self-reliance, and personal responsibility were all epitomized by George Washington and are deeply valued by the conservative movement. Sobriety and modesty,as well as interest in character and morals were championed by him in both public and private. Such values are timeless and are just as important today as they were then. The man who could have been king of a new country instead helped birth a constitutional Republic. It is our job as conservatives to protect and defend the ideals of that Republic from those who seek to dismantle it and protect and preserve the traditions and values of Western Civilization that have been passed down to us. Conservatism is no Johnny come lately political ideology, but one that was, in reality and in practice, championed by the Father of our country and whose roots and fundamental principles run back all the way to the very beginning of Western Civilization. The fact is that all the various political or ideological graphs and lines, for some reason, put those who believe in small government, constitutional governance, traditional values, and free enterprise over to the far right of the American political spectrum and attempt to infer that it is an extreme position are fundamentally flawed. Instead, that should be the starting, middle point of the American ideological spectrum. For that is where most of the Founders of the country including George Washington would be found. Instead, it is all ideologies and isms that champion corporatism, globalism, the mainstreaming of homosexuality, socialism, the dismantling of traditional marriage and the nuclear family unit, and disrespect for the fundamental sanctity of innocent human life that are in fact the extremes and should be portrayed as such. For they are the positions that stray from the path, morals, values, and ideals of the founding of the Republic. It is they who pose the danger to the fundamental character, ideals, and beliefs that this country was founded upon. The man who was first in war, first in peace, and first in the hearts of his countrymen and called the Father of his country even during his lifetime is one that should be emulated in many ways. Yet such a man today, in the eyes of liberalism, would be one worthy of derision and condemnation. Not all ideologies are of equal worth, and Ill gladly stand by one practiced by George Washington, the original, right-wing extremist. ",3

2,"MINDBOGGLING REPORT: Non-Military Government Agencies Armed To The Teeth U. S. Marshals special operations should be equiped like so. Other federal agencies? In the last few years, we out here on the fruited plain have heard over and over that for some reason, various government agencies are spending millions on military style equipment. Thanks to American Transparency, the people behind OpentheBooks.com and their report titled,The Militarization of America we now know what the non-military agencies spent and what they spent it on from 2006-2014. When it comes to say, the FBI or the U.S. Marshalls service, the Border Patrol or even ICE, being armed to the teeth is to be expected. They are supposed to be the good guys with the guns. But this list? The list of administrative agencies collectively acquiring millions of dollars of military style guns, ammo and equipment goes on to include the U.S. Mint, Bureau of Engraving and Printing, NOAA, Nuclear Regulatory Commission, Office of Inspector General and much more. In all, non-law enforcement agencies spent $335.1 million. Thats almost a dollar per American citizen. For weapons that can be used against us if the government so chooses. Whats also interesting is WHEN the big time spending happened. Check this out: Barack Obama occupied the Oval Office in 2009 when the Democrats controlled the purse strings. TEA Partiers swept in to Congress in 2011. Things that make you go hmm. The data for the report from American Transparency came from information available thanks to the 2006 Federal Funding Accountability and Transparency Act. It is systematically cataloged in very efficient tables and graphics that tell the story of government spending on equipment like this. Yes, for some reason the federal government is loading up on grenades, launchers and paint guns. Tasersthats more of a gray area. But still, this is the tip of the iceberg. Within the report, there are whole pages of pictures of what the government purchased: night vision goggles, body armor, bullet-proof vests, pistols, rifles, ammunition, trigger locks, and more. Check out this graphic: And thats just the IRS. Page 23 of the report outlines what the FDA and Health and Human Services spent. (Why do they need close to a million dollars worth of ballistic vests systems? Just curious.) Overall, that particular department is the one with the most unexplained spending. The 13 federal agencies that make up the law enforcement arm of the government spent $1.1445 Billion that was split close to evenly between equipment and ammunition. They also have added tens of thousands of officers. Yes, these agencies are needed, and a lot of the spending is justified, but stillwhy so many and so much? For years now, the government has been loading up on defense equipment that could easily be used for offense in any conflict. Now, the question iswho are feds thinking they are going to need to fight? The full report is worth a read. Follow this link to open it in a new window. ",3
2,"[Watch] Ferguson Protesters Kick And Cuss Out CNN, Local Media Plus More Overnight Antics On the St. Louis-Ferguson scanners, weve been hearing for days that the protesters have been kicking CNN out of the protest areas. Now it seems that one of the more thorough of the local television news stations, KMOV the local CBS affiliate, is also a target of the protesters rage. Somebody finally caught it on video from Bassem Masris live feed. (Masri is an anarchist, but this is the best video out there.) The media is on the side ofTHE POLICE?! All along? Of course the media has been spinning the stories so that they make a profit, but are these people reading the same stories? All the unarmed teen references and St. Michael stories? If the whole point is to get their message out, wouldnt they be giving their elevator speeches to the people with the most reach? Oh, thats right, logic doesnt work with this crowd. It was hoped that things would die down a bit after the official autopsy report and other assorted forensic evidence was leaked to the media and thus the public, but the protesters and whoever is organizing them (and paying them) are determined and starting yesterday afternoon, things started going down this time with reinforcements from college student aged people (word is there are a lot of Saint Louis University students joining the peaceful protests). First, about fifty people tried to occupy County Police Headquarters in the late afternoon. Then protesters up in Ferguson knocked down barricades set up to keep the protesters out of the street. After that, they stormed a Walgreens and tried to shut down a Shop n Save. The police maintained a presence and so long as nothing violent happens they stay out of the way, but last night bottles were thrown, big fireworks were lit per the scanner, and several people got arrested. It was a long night. So far, when it comes to what is reported on the scanners, there is a lot of information coming from Twitter. Sometimes the crowd gets it right, sometimes they dont, like last nights report that the makings of Molotov cocktails were in the crowd. Could have been, but there are no photos. There were also reports that recruiting for people to challenge the police was going on on Craigs List, but that cant be confirmed. More information can be found on the Ferguson Scanner updates and Ferguson/Saint Louis Riots Updates Facebook pages.

2,"While We Werent Watching: Obama Reveals Plans For Nationalizing Police Without Being Obvious About It Aside from communications, if there is any one thing that a dictator needs to stay in power, its local police forces. To an end to be named later, Barack Obama and his merry band of outlaws have come up with a carrot and stick sort of incentive arrangement to bring local police into line: Obama is trying to expand progressive control by attaching more conditions to federal funding of state and local law-enforcement efforts. We can expand the [federally-funded] COPS programto see if we can get more incentives for local communities to apply some of the best practices and lessons that are embodied in [ Task Force on 21st Century Policing] report, he said. Those best practices likely will eventually include rules that restrict police investigations of groups that are part of the Democratic coalition, and rules that try to level convictions and penalties among various sub-groups of the United Stats, regardless of actual conviction rates. Yeah. Thats fair. Adopt our best practices or we take away the money. (Actually, thats how the American drinking age got to be 21.) But, wait, theres more: I think communities [with police forces] across the board are going to need to consider recommendations around prohibiting racial profiling [and] thats a step that weve already taken at the federal level, Obama said. The report also calls for government to collect more data about state and local policing. That data will help federal officials impose new rules. We need more information to find out how to take to scale best practices when it comes to training so that police officers are able to work in a way that reduces the possibilities of bias, Obama said. State and local policing may need to be subordinated to federal social policy, Obama suggested. Our approach to our drug laws, for example, and criminalization of nonviolent offenses rather than taking more of a public health approach that may be something that has an impact in eroding trust between law enforcement and communities. So much for the idea that local jurisdictions know best how to police in their own back yards. Or that some level of profiling happens racial or otherwise whether the people and the police like it or not. The concept that the nations drug laws are actually largely federal and that the local LEOs are already following federal rulesoh, wait. Nothing to see here. Move along. Time must be made to acknowledge the shame and guilt factors of excessive policing, though: Law enforcement agencies should acknowledge the role of policing in past and present injustice and discrimination and how it is a hurdle to the promotion of community trust, the report says.The Federal Government, as well as state and local agencies, should encourage and incentivize higher education for law enforcement officers. Not sure what higher education has to do with it since highly educated people tend not to have much in the way of street smarts, but just like the rest of the left, Obamas report blames the police, not the perpetrators for any wrongdoing. There is more to the Daily Caller piece quoted above, and more guilt by association wording from the report. The true bottom line is that this is a nationally progressive move aimed at keeping Democratic constituents out of jail. Given that prison is a breeding ground for Islamic conversion, in and of itself, that might not be a bad thing, but there has to be some punishment for breaking laws or it will happen over and over creating a lawless class of honest to goodness societal leaches worse than the one we have now. Oh, and then theres that dictatorship thing. Additional reading at DC Clothesline. They are offering incentives, not strong arming jurisdictions, yet. Participation is voluntary. But who can say no to cash? The money would come from the federal budget, so, naturally, congress has to appropriate it. They could choose to defund it. But we expected the congress to be on the side of the people before, and they betrayed us. I have a questionis this nationalizing the police an issue (law) that should have come from CongressIs this UNCONSTITUTIONAL??? Thanks.. Thats a possible scenario; Stay vigilant my friends. Under Obamas plan..only the thugs and his new army will be armedpatriots will be the minority This has been happening in the corrections scene for decades. More criminals on the streets means more lawlessness and separation. And not one soul in congress will stand up for AmericaEXCEPT TREY GOUDY ! The next Ferguson will be much larger under these rules. And if the police take the bait and follow these rules it will lead us to civil war. And in the midst of this while Americans kill each other the Muslims will attack. . ",3

There is also more than enough evidence to lead one to conclude that those in their positions could have been placed there precisely to stifle or impede investigations by Congress and others. They point out that were it not for the efforts of Judicial Watch and the House Oversight and Reform Committee, we would likely never have known the levels of corruption and abuse of power that are starting to be revealed. They also ask the question as to why no Special Prosecutor has been named. This video summary is just more evidence of the fact that Hussein Obama is the public face of the most corrupt, criminal organization this nation has ever seen, which pervades to some degree virtually every branch of government.

2,"Hillary Clinton Needs Earth Day Donations - To Help The Trees and Herself The president of the international criminal enterprise known as The Clinton Foundation, Donna Shalala, has brought out her loaded manure spreader in honor of the fake holiday of Earth Day. Shes set the distribution pattern to wide, and the speed to high, with a Tuesday mailing in which the dire false claims of a climate emergency are once again being pitched to the ignorant masses based upon fabrications that, as is customary, are supposedly taking place in a mystical land, far, far away. This latest fairy tale is once again set in the mysterious land of Kenya, scene of a previous great work of fiction and deception, the Obama story. Just as Obama went to Alaska, toured an island experiencing erosion and declared it conclusive evidence that sea level is rising, the nonsense merchants on the left are somehow twisting the tropical jungles of Kenya being harvested as evidence that activity of the evil humans is heating the planet and killing Kenyas trees. Its not unlike the harvesting of corn in Iowa is proof of how global warming has made that crop an endangered species. Its just one fairy tale away from being declared a reality. Shalala starts her unsubstantiated assertions of climate change by making wild claims that People all around the world are already feeling its effects, including decreased crop production, unreliable access to food and water, and extreme weather patterns. Her rant includes the untrue declaration that Theres no doubt about it these challenges are vast. She adds, But Im reassured that even the smallest actions can have a big impact for years to come. Her claims are based upon anecdotal evidence provided by a photograph of a real Kenyan and a story spun as being his. Shalala says, We all have a role to play in building a brighter future just ask Ndirangu Macharia. Not speaking the Kenyan language, having Ndirangus cell phone number, or any desire to talk to him, Donna knows we wont be asking Ndirangu anything. She wrote, For the past 70 years, Ndirangu has lived in Kenyas lush highlands and seen firsthand the effects of deforestation. As chairman of a local tree nursery, he knows that without trees, soil quality degrades and weather patterns become erratic, ultimately threatening farmers livelihoods. While she addresses deforestation in the lush highlands, theres no indication that it has anything to do with a changing climate. In fact, while the percentage of forest in Kenya is only 7 percent, the amount of agricultural land is 47 percent, an indication, since things are being grown on it, that the absence of trees is not due to a lack of water or overly warm temperatures, but rather a deliberate act of clearing and cultivation. Half-truths fit much better into the leftists narrative and, in the spirit of Earth Day, give them a premise, false as it may be, to fire up the old faithful to spread their message. Since he works as the chairman of a tree nursery, it seems that Ndirangu is engaged in planting more trees already, possibly as a crop in a for-profit venture. She says that the Clinton Foundation is engaged in planting 100,000 trees because Kenya is presently down to 7 percent forest coverage. The Kenyan constitution calls for ten percent forestation, so they are at a less than impressive 3 percent deficit. Why is it that Hillary and Bill Clinton are worried about the number of trees in Obamas homeland? They pat themselves on the back, saying, We use climate data to help farmers like Ndirangu learn where newly planted trees would be most beneficial. Within his community, Ndirangu is turning this data into action and becoming a leader in promoting reforestation efforts. Are we to believe that the criminal Clintons randomly picked the Kenyan people as the recipients of their humanitarian attention simply because poor, pathetic Ndirangu isnt smart enough to figure out where to plant the trees on his own? Hes been in the business for 70 years, is chairman of the nursery but still hasnt mastered the most basic component, where to plant new trees? She quoted the Kenyan as saying, Our responsibility is to plant trees. Trees are what change the weather, increase the amount of water, and bring rain. This project has really helped our community because it has improved our livelihoods. We are very, very happy. Those trees theyve planted are already grown and have begun impacting the weather patterns? Thats amazing considering the forestation levels in Kenya havent changed. Just like flipping a switch, saplings have changed the weather and created rain. The community is doing great. If hes very, very happy now, we can only imagine how ecstatic hell be when the trees have actually had time to grow. Ndirangu and his fellow community members are proof that one tree at a time we can improve livelihoods today and build a more sustainable tomorrow, wrote Shalala. In celebration of Earth Day, we want you to help us improve the lives of more farmers like Ndirangu. That offer to be included in making other Ndirangus happy was followed by a strategically positioned big orange donate button. Could there possibly be a financial motive to the Clintons concern over Ndirangu, his trees and his villages happiness? Isnt that the only explanation that makes any sense?

2,"Defiant Art Contest to Put a Face on Mohammad Pamela Geller is nothing if not gutsy. The head of theAmerican Freedom Defense Initiative is planning a spring Inaugural Muhammad Art Exhibit Contest in Garland, Texas, with depictions of Mohammad in the same place where Muslims held a Stand with the Prophet conference in January. The Stand with the Prophet conference followed the Islamic jihadist shootings at the Charlie Hebdo office in Paris protesting their cartoons of the alleged prophet Mohammad. Geller drew some 2,000 people opposing the Stand with the Prophet conference with her own free-speech rally. The purpose of the AFDIs art program is to strike a blow for freedom of expression in defiance of Islamic attempts to intimidate. The in-your-face contest, with a top prize of $10,000, will be held May 3 in the Curtis Caldwell Center for artists and cartoonists who want to draw or paintthe founder of Islam. Entries are due April 5. This event will stand for free speech and show that Americans will not be cowed by violent Islamic intimidation, Geller said in a news release. That is a crucial stand to take as Islamic assaults on the freedom of speech, our most fundamental freedom, are growing more insistent. If the Western media ran the Danish cartoons back when this Islamic supremacist movement first started gaining steam, the editorial staff ofCharlie Hebdowould be alive today, Geller toldBreitbart Texas. That said, the European press ran theHebdocartoons in the wake of that jihad slaughter. But the American press would not. The beacon of freedom, the shining light on a hill, is running scared. Well, thats not who we are. The elites do not represent the people. Enough is enough, she explained. Theyre just cartoons. Were holding this exhibit and cartoon contest to show how insane the world has becomewith people in the free world tiptoeing in terror around supremacist thugs who actually commit murder over cartoons. If we cant stand up for the freedom of speech, we will lose itand with it, free society. The exhibit will feature images of Islams prophet in both historical and contemporary settings. Free-speech advocates will address the gathering. This event will stand for free speech and show that Americans will not be cowed by violent Islamic intimidation, she said. That is a crucial stand to take as Islamic assaults on the freedom of speech, our most fundamental freedom, are growing more insistent. Of course, this event will require massive security, she assured potential attendees. But this exhibit has to be staged. If we dont show the jihadis that they will not frighten us into silence, the jihad against freedom will only grow more virulent. An author and activist, Geller has been warning about Muslim encroachment into Europe and America and the possible impact on American culture. For more information on the exhibit, including rules, click on this link. GO Texas! I wish I was an octopus so I could slapped several people at the same time! The law here, you know the United States of America, is the Constitution! Dont like it you are free to leave and take your ass to Iraq or any number of countries that are Islamic! I dont see the Jews killing, beheading, stoning or killing people on a cross! Keep giving into Moslems and you will see it right here in the USA! Mark my word! Enough is enough, she explained. Theyre just cartoons.. So are the ones showing Jews as an octopus with their controlling tentacles in many nations. Has Pamela Geller denounced Rabbi Ovadia Yosefs statement that Gentiles only exist it serve Jews. ",3
2,"Skydiver Aikins No Parachute Jump Into Net Luke Aikins disagrees with the common assessment that he was crazy to try such a stunt. Maybe its all in how you define crazy. Wouldout of his mind be more appropriate? Aikins is an expert, third generation skydiver and stuntman who has been practicing and working out the details for this jump for two years. He said he would do it and was true to his word. The fact that he jumped without a parachute or a wing suit is amazing. Whats even more noteworthy is he lived to tell about it. Aikins emerged from the 10,000 SF net no worse for the wear and a skydiving legend. The free fall from 25,000 feet took approximately two minutes. He was accompanied for the first part of the jump by three other skydivers, all wearing parachutes, one with a camera, another with an oxygen tank, all were trailing smoke to help observers on the ground. Aikins is a highly trained professional, a trainer and a trainer of trainers whose family owns Skydive Kapowsin near Tacoma, Wash. Hes got over 18,000 jumps to his credit but this was arguably, aside from that first jump, his biggest one. The event took place at an old movie lot in Simi Valley, California. Aikins utilized a mystery device of a type that has not yet been fully revealed. It is described only as a slide to assist in the back landing. At a point where he had about a second left to impact, Aikins flipped over onto his back for a perfect one point landing. He immediately jumped up and hugged his wife and child. There was no reporter asking the question about going to Disneyland. Its understandable. Its hard to imagine that theres anything at any Disney property that could compete with what he just experienced. ",1
2,"Paris Attacks Reignite Online Surveillance Feud As ISIS Goes To The Dark Web Never let a crisis go to waste. Now that ISIS is on the move again and not just threatening coordinated terrorist acts, but carrying them out, one of the first orders of business is to penetrate their communications. Naturally. After all, this is warand the Obama Administration likes to think war can be waged without getting our boots dirty. So, of course, this means that the American people and the Silicon Valley companies that provide the social media platforms we all use just HAVE to let the government have a back door to social media programming so that the CIA and the FBI can snoop around the terrorists communications (and the rest of Americas) by-passing the encryption that Twitter, Facebook, PlayStation and any other platform uses. And why should the Silicon Valley people do the governments bidding? Because Senators John McCain and Dianne Feinstein say so. Well, about that notion that ISIS is using just Twitter and PlayStation4 to communicate, and that Anonymous is busy disrupting their activitiesum, according to the encrypto people, to get to the actual terrorists at the top of the food chain, just about everyone is looking in the wrong place aside from causing established networks to go dark. According to multiple sources as reported by The New American, ISIS Al Qaeda developedtheir own encryption system: In fact, a newly released study by Flashpoint Global Partners shows that not only are terrorists creating their own tools for encrypted communications, they were doing so before Snowdens revelations. More importantly, their use of cryptographic tools has not increased in the more than two years since those revelations. As the report explains: For many years, the jihadi community has been cognizant of the benefits of encrypted communications and, as such, has developed its own proprietary cryptologic software in order to meet this demand. In October 2010, Al Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula (AQAP) dedicated an entire sub-section of its English-language Inspire magazine to help teach would-be AQAP recruits about the need for digital encryption. As The Daily Dot reported: In 2007, well before the Snowden revelations in 2013, software called Asrar al-Mujahideen (Secrets of the Mujahideen) was released on an Al Qaeda Web forum known as al-Ekhlaas. This software is used to encrypt messages and files between users and is promoted as a trusted and secure avenue for terrorist groups, according to Flashpoint. To add insult to that injury for the McCain-Feinstein argument of backdoors and letting the American government into the various social media platforms for security purposes, reports from the underbelly of the internet are that the ISIS propagandizers an offshoot of Al Qaeda have a mirror site set up on Tor, an open source system not indexed by Google, accessed via a modified Firefox browser and one of the most difficult onion platforms to navigate for anyone trying to trace a location or a user. A mirror of an ISIS propaganda site has launched as a Tor hidden service, likely in an attempt to make its material more resilient to take-downs, or to protect the identity of the groups supporters. Online terrorism researcher Scot Terban wrote on his blog on Sunday that the Al-Hayat Media Center, which is affiliated with ISIS, has posted a link and explanation on how to get to their new dark net site on a forum associated with the group. Links to the site were also published by a number of jihadi-linked Twitter accounts, Motherboard found. Its legitimate, J M Berger, co-author of the book ISIS: The State of Terror, told Motherboard in an email. My understanding is that this is just a mirror of another ISIS site, he added. This means that the site is only republishing content from elsewhere. Mirrors are often used when sites are at risk of being taken down. So, no matter how many sites and Twitter accounts ISIS has set up for its foot soldiers that Anonymous and the other white hat hackers out there take down, ISIS has an online presence and theyve developed their own encryption to protect it, even if they may not be using it all. Given this information, the New American asks the question that needs to be answered before any more American liberties are breached in the name of security: So, if terrorists are not increasing their use of cryptography and if the tools they are using are proprietary tools developed in-house, why is the American intelligence community demanding that the tools Americans use be weakened? Is it about security or is it about control? Considering that they are using the deaths of 129 ordinary citizens and the the wounding of hundreds more to perpetuate their myths about the use of cryptography, the answer is evident. Watching this round of the encryption wars unfold has been rather telling actually. Anonymous takes less than 72 hours to identify and take down THOUSANDS of jihadi Twitter accounts. Ghost Security Group, a group of ethical hackers hovering around Bitcoin, found and was able to shut down ISIS funding done through the online currency. Thanks to other users of the dark web and associated open source software, we now know that ISIS is nimble enough technologically speaking to operate outside of the commercial software services and hacking abilities. With that known, the Obama Administration is still talking about monitoring social media. And members of the Senate are still demanding back doors into private programming which is someone elses intellectual property. The American government is really lagging behind if this is honestly where their concerns and emphasis is concentrated. Either that, or this is another crisis just too important to waste. More intrigue and information on Tor and laymans language of the Dark Web can be found at International Business Times. ",3
2,"Science Says: Ladies, Just Say No To Hot Guys Its the news all women who have dated know and dont always talk about, but now has an actual scientific conclusion to back the generality: the most attractive men out there, the ones that make us girls pant, are, for the most part, well, selfish aholes as described by Charlotte Litton of The Daily Beast. Psychologists at Brunel University in London measured the bodies of 125 men and women using a 3D scanner, calculating traditionally attractive traits such as slimness and waist-to-hip ratio (for the latter group). They then completed a personality test, which assessed their attitudes to selfishness and inequality, before partaking in a money-based economics experiment, designed to challenge their beliefs on having and sharing wealth. Our results showed that in fact we may be justified in expecting more attractive men to behave in ways that are less favourable to economic and social equality, says the papers lead investigator, Dr. Michael Price. The results suggest that better-looking men may be biased towards being more selfish and less egalitarian. And they are amazingly biased in the who they will date department, too. Two ounces of cellulite on a woman in the wrong place equals disqualified. (Oops, did I say that?) In the ever increasing world of we must prove absolutely everything scientifically this information might evoke shoulder shrugs from most women who have been thrown over by guys who go after young, nubile, and perfectly lovely in their own right ladies for what we assume are strictly visual reasons. (And its highly entertaining when those young ladies tell them to get lost, although that happens less often to the truly hot guys.) The question that really needs to be answered is why this is the case. The answer coming from this study is very simple: because of a complete accident of nature, they can: Attractiveness being perceived as a strength dates back to early human ancestral environments, where physically admirable or formidable people were deemed to have a greater ability to benefit or harm others, thus increasing their bargaining power in social situations. These naturally-bestowed traits, such as fitness and developmental stability, would have given them a certain predisposition to win social competitions, thereby benefitting from any advanced status or resources that followed. This unequal balance would swing in favor of societys lookers, meaning that they would value social norms promoting inequality as it would serve them best, while average Joes would find those promoting equality the most advantageous. Hence why any woman would pant over such hotness. Its the way we are hardwired. To put it mildly, guys who are hot and know it, by virtue of their good looks, are predisposed to success and monetary stability. Dr. Price [says]people who are more attractive have to do less to make themselves valuable to other people [because] theyre already highly valued by virtue of their high attractiveness. This isnt the end of the road for self-serving sexpots, though: The best way to help people overcome a bias is to make them more conscious that they have it, Dr. Price advises. So, if a guy is a self-centered, spoiled, spends too many hours in the gym, and happens to be dripping with testosterone, the best thing for him is to tell him so? Sure. Or, we ladies can do what they really need to hear and feel and just dump the dude, even if he is pretty to look at. (Not that it would really matter since such guys can just find arm candy where ever they go.) What was shocking to the researchers, though, is that the attractiveness anti-social traits do not translate always across gender lines: While these assessments were valid for the men in the study, a perhaps unprecedented development was among the women involved, who were found to be no more selfish than average- lookers. This proves that hotties arent hard-wired to be douchier than notties, just that good looking men are seemingly incapable of caring about anyone other than themselves. Good job, guys! In the parlance of Ms. Litton, notties arent fawned over to the point of letting their looks go to their heads. Of course, this generality is not true for all men, just as it is true that witchy women come in all shapes and sizes. Some of the most annoying and truly selfish men this writer has encountered were in no way hot regardless of how much iron they pumped. What it does prove, though, is that good-looking guys have to be careful about letting attention due to those looks blind them to their own human failings. Just as an aside and piece of advice to guys writing online dating profiles: ripped and hard body are red flag phrases. Also, wife beater t-shirts are not attractive unless one is at the beach or the pool. Being reasonably fit is one thing. Bragging about the hours spent in the gym and showing offyeah, you get the picture. ",1
2,"Zombie Burglar admits Taking Human Brain A Pennsylvania man has been dubbed the Zombie burglar, is now facing new charges after admitting to using a stolen human brain to make a potent form of marijuana. The man was already in custody charged in a string of local burglaries. Police said that Joshua Long, 26, was formally charged Thursday withmisdemeanor abuse of a corpse and conspiracy to commit abuse of a corpse. Investigators in charge of the case told reporters that Longs aunt discovered the brain last month. The detective said that the mans aunt discovered that long was keeping it in a Wal-Mart shopping bag under the porch of a trailer where one of Longs friends lived. Of course he was, where else would you keep a stolen Human Brain? A Local media report, citing a police officer said, that when Longs aunt asked him about the brain, Long admitted to her that it was a human organ and that he and his friend, Robbie Lee Zoller, would soak marijuana in the preserving formaldehyde. Authorities say the high from smoking so-called wet marijuana is intense and dangerous, often causing hallucinations. But not wanting to appear to be crude and insensitive, Long told his aunt that he and Zoller had thoughtfully given the brain a name, they called it Freddy. A police spokesman said that investigators believe the brain was a stolen teaching specimen taken from some nearby college or university. At this point now were just trying to figure out where it came from, Pennsylvania State Trooper Robert Hicks told reporters. Were hoping that if anyone is missing a human specimen brain to bring it to our attention and maybe we can return it to its rightful owner. Zoller and another relative of Longs, Angela Micklo, are being sought in connection with the theft. At this time of this report, neither Long nor Freddy were available for comment. Police started to request that if you or someone you know was missing a human brain that you contact them. However, after some careful though on their part, it was decided that was not a good idea. They were afraid that the station could be flooded will thousands of calls from Liberals. Fox News contributed to this story. 2016 R. L. Grimes ",1
2,"Hillarys Private Emails: Some Surfaced Online Two Years Ago, Outline Her Personal Spy Network Forget the wiped server that Hillary Clintons camp turned over to the Special Committee on Benghazi this week. Online publication Gawker with Pro Publica has linked its latest Clinton email scandal story to a 2013 post titled, Hacked Emails Show Hillary Clinton Was Receiving Advice At A Private Email Account From Banned, Obama-Hating Former Staffer and with that connection, a whole new look at Hillarys time at State may well have opened up. It seems that a rather infamousRomanian hacker Marcel-Lehel Lazarcalling himself Guccifer hacked into any number of politicians and aides private email accounts a couple years ago, and circulated what was purportedly found via email blasts. One of the people who Guccifer outed was Sid Blumenthal known as Sid Vicious in political circles according to Hugh Hewitt andChuck Todd and one of the matters discussed in the emails Sid sent to Hillary from an AOL account was, you guessed it, Benghazi. Since Lazar is fairly obsessed with the main one world, globalist conspiracy meme and regularly makes the cryptic cabal called Illuminati his targets, the cache at the time did not make it past websites with similar interests, and the true pajamas media. However, in the past few days, as the Hillary Clinton camp is playing a very sloppy game of cat and mouse with Rep. Trey Gowdy and his Benghazi committee, the emails published by Lazar have taken on tremendous significance. So much so, that Sid Blumenthals private email account from which many of the private intelligence laced emails relating to Benghazi both before and after the September 11, 2012 attack, was the subject of an Ed Morrissey HotAir piece. Could it be that THIS and not fundraising work for the Clinton Foundation was what Hillary was trying to hide with a private email server? Was Sid Blumenthal, a man rejected by the Obama Administration when Hillary requested he work under her at State because he doesnt like Obama, running a secret intelligence service for Mrs. Clinton when she was Secretary of State? (Like she didnt trust the CIA or something.) According to what has been pieced together by Gawker, Blumenthal more or less ran a parallel intelligence operation getting information from sources on the ground in multiple countries using former CIA operatives and their contacts to obtain information that may or may not have made it to the Secretarys office via the White House. What Hillary would have known via official channels is another matter, and the true motivation for the duplication is known only to her, but it is rather interesting that a woman who was fired from the Watergate investigation was most likely doing the same sort of sneaky stuff that Richard Nixon did while he was president with the plumbers and all that. As for what the Blumenthal emails, as well as some other supplementary characters, provided is that weeks before the Benghazi attack it was known that the security climate in Libya was in a downward spiral. There were a number of small attacks attributed to late Libyan Prime Minister Muammar Gaddafi loyalists prior to September 11, 2012. The infamous video appears as a cause of the Benghazi attack initially and then is dismissed less than 48 hours after the event as more is learned and Libyan security officials believed an Islamist radical group called the Ansa al Sharia brigade had prepared the attack a month in advance and took advantage of the cover provided by the demonstrations against the video. That pretty much matches testimony from CIA officials who came to similar conclusions. (The full set of Blumenthal Benghazi related emails is available at the bottom of this Gawker piece.) There is quite a bit of additional information in the Gawker and HotAir pieces referenced above, but within the scope of the Benghazi investigation, the fact that Hillary had her own private spy service and they knew that things were deteriorating in Libya does not bode well for any reason to have left the ambassador to the country and members of his security team exposed. Not only that, it still does not explain what Chris Stephens and company were doing in the desert that night. And then there was this from yesterdays Gawker piece: Whatever Blumenthal, Shearer, Drumheller, and Grange were up to in 2011, 2012, and 2013 on Clintons behalf, it appears that she could have used the help: According to State Department personnel directories, in 2011 and 2012the height of the Libya crisisState didnt have a Libyan desk officer, and the entire Near Eastern Maghreb Bureau, which which covers Algeria, Tunisia, Morocco and Libya, had just two staffers. Today, State has three Libyan desk officers and 11 people in the Near Eastern Maghreb Bureau. A State Department official wouldnt say how many officers were on the desk in 2011, but said there was always at least one officer, and sometimes many more, working on Libya. It all just gets deeper and deeper, and all the onion pealing going on is getting really fascinating or depressing depending on ones point of view. Hillary had no oversight, there was no Libya desk officer, everyone knew the YouTube story was a ruse and yet Susan Rice repeated it ad nauseam, thereve been multiple government investigations into the attack at Benghazi and the reason nothing has been found is because the real information on what was going on was nowhere near the State Department. So far, there is no indication that the Special Committee on Benghazi has taken an interest in Sid Blumenthals emails or what a hacker (who might be the real thing or a really clever con artist) published two years ago. However, in light of the wiped server delivered to Capitol Hill, expect to see all this explode in the coming weeks. Its always a good idea for executives to have multiple sources for information and utilize private investigation and security services. When the executive in question is a government official, on the other hand. ",3
2,"BREAKING: SCOTUS Strikes Down Texas Abortion Regulations The Supreme Court struck down Texas widely replicated regulation of abortion clinics Monday in the courts biggest abortion case in nearly a quarter century. The justices voted 5-3 in favor of Texas clinics that had argued the regulations were only a veiled attempt to make it harder for women to get abortions in the nations second-most populous state. Justice Stephen Breyers majority opinion for the court held that the regulations are medically unnecessary and unconstitutionally limit a womans right to an abortion. Texas had argued that its 2013 law and subsequent regulations were needed to protect womens health. The rules required doctors who perform abortions to have admitting privileges at nearby hospitals and forced clinics to meet hospital-like standards for outpatient surgery. Breyer wrote that the surgical-center requirement, like the admitting privileges requirement, provides few, if any, health benefits for women, poses a substantial obstacle to women seeking abortions and constitutes an undue burden on their constitutional right to do so. Justices Anthony Kennedy, Ruth Bader Ginsburg, Sonia Sotomayor and Elena Kagan joined Breyer. Alito, reading a summary of his dissent in court, said the clinics should have lost on technical, procedural grounds. Alito said the court was adopting a rule of, If at first you dont succeed, sue, sue again. My opinion is that I fail to see where in our Constitution it is written that a women has the right to murder an unborn child. Our rights are always up for debate, actual rights that we have. Yet ones that dont exist are protected. ",4
2,"EPA Has Outside Environmentalists Writing Their Regulations, Targeting Millions of Americans The Environmental Protection Agency, an overbearing regulatory menace, is now showing themselves to be little more than the government muscle behind an environmental agenda aimed at sending Americans back to pre-industrial revolutionary times. In what appears to be an obvious abuse of power and dereliction of duty, the EPA, under the energy-hostile leadership of Gina McCarthy, has been permitting environmental activists to write their agencies policies. Those are policies which have a tremendous impact on the lives of Americans in innumerable ways, from employment to home energy costs to the control and regulation that the agency assumes over our daily lives. As distasteful as the dictatorial agency is itself, the fact that enemies of free enterprise and freedom in general are mandating from behind the scenes is particularly offensive. Senator David Vitter(R-LA) has long been on the scent of impropriety and abuses at the EPA and he, along with veteran watchdog Rep Darrel Issa (R-CA), are launching investigations into the collusion. Of particular concern is the relationship between the EPA and the Natural Resources Defense Council (NRDC). Emails indicate that inappropriate levels of influence existed between the two and that it directly impacted public policy. The lawmakers released some of that evidence on Wednesday to illustrate the severity of the problem. Senator Vitter said, The EPA is clearly allowing the NRDC to assist in drafting federal regulation, with a heavy-hand in numerous economically destructive policies. This influence is putting American families and future generations on the hook for years of lost opportunity and regulatory burden. The investigation resulted from news reports that NRDC wrote the EPAs 2014 regulations which targeted Co2. That rule, announced in June, mislabeled carbon dioxide as a pollutant, and set seriously destructive energy standards for emissions. It will virtually eliminate coal as a fuel within the United States and tremendously increase the price of our electricity as well as negatively impacting our domestic electrical generating capacity and availability. One of the most revealing emails, from 2011, had no text in the body, but the subject line contained the words: Accepted: Meeting with NRDC on Section 111 Standards for Power Plants. That meeting took place as NRDC was composing the policy proposal that set the new crippling carbon dioxide emissions standards. The New York Times reported the names of those NRDC lobbyists drafting the regulations in July. They described their efforts, saying, Indisputable, however, is that the Natural Resources Defense Council was far ahead of the E.P.A. in drafting the architecture of the proposed regulation. They were apparently so far ahead because they were the ones writing the regulation. Vitter also released an email chain from 2009 in which then-Deputy Asst Administrator McCarthy discussed getting together with NRDCs Daniel Lashoff, one of those authors, to hash out environmental policy. The NRDC claims there is no impropriety, saying, These emails show an advocacy group doing its job, We sent our priorities to EPA and made personnel suggestions. Welcome to Washington. The fact that the NRDC is operating from Washington should not be a free pass to illegality. The authoritarian and oppressive EPA no longer serves the needs of the American people. They serve the elites and special interests who gain financially from the restrictions imposed upon the rest of us. The agency needs to be eliminated and some of their people need to be in a protected environment surrounded by bars, locks and guards.

2,"Two Hundred Seventy Nine Killed In Twenty Four Hours.. Iraqi forces have killed 279 militants in 24 hours, as they push back against a major militant offensive, a security spokesman has said. Mr Kerry met with Iraqi foreign minister Hoshyar Zebari about providing help in fighting the ISIS jihadists, who have took control of several cities in the past week, the state department said in a statement. He expressed to the foreign minister that help from the United States would only be successful if Iraqi leaders were willing to put aside differences and implement a coordinated and effective approach to forge the national unity necessary to move the country forward and face the threat of [ISIS], the statement said. Mr Kerry also suggested Iraq to rapidly ratify the results of recent elections and to form a new government.In the crucial belt of territory north and north-east of Baghdad where the predominantly Sunni militants have penetrated within striking distance of the capital, government forces are pushing back. With Shiite militias fighting by the side of security forces against the militants, the struggle has taken on a strong sectarian dimension. Last week, the Iraqi parliament failed to convene for a vote on declaring a state of emergency due to a boycott by most Sunni and Kurdish politicians. The Iraqi foreign ministry said in a statement that Mr Kerry pledged $12 million in support and stressed that Baghdad should assure its neighbours the war is not sectarian, but against the insurgents. US president Barack Obama said on Friday he was reviewing military options, short of sending troops, to combat the insurgency.The US sent an aircraft carrier into the Gulf on Saturday, readying it in case Washington decides to pursue a military option after insurgents overran areas in the north and advanced on Baghdad.

2,"Election Official Runs Away When Questioned About Assisting In Election Fraud The Texas Director of Elections has something to hide. It appears there is something that he doesnt want the American people and the people of Texas to know about their votes. David Knight of Infowars just wanted to ask this supposed public servant why hes adopted a policy that seems to be designed to embrace voter fraud, to compromise the integrity of the election process rather than to protect or ensure it. As Keith Ingram was heading downstairs he made it most of the way, lacking only one flight of steps of being there. Thats when he saw trouble lurking in his path, those notorious Infowars guys were after him again. Whats a corrupt politician to do when he confronted by honest media with nowhere to hide? There was only one solution, the last result of compromised global lackey politicians. Ingram ran the other way. He turned tail like a cowardly elementary school kid who sees the bully is waiting for him after school. As the cowardly and compromised official made a run for it, Knight asked him, You dont want to talk to us? Ingram indicated that the in fact did not. Knight asked him again, Really, you dont want to talk to us at all? People are concerned the elections going to be rigged, I guess theyre really going to be concerned when they see you turn your back on us. He asks if he can talk to anyone, or if they all want to rig this. He shouts out his question to the runaway official, asking, Why are you cutting off all of these audit trails? Why are you cutting down the paper audit trails? This political appointee who had no experience in managing elections before being given the job previously worked as a political appointment to Governor Rick Perry. His area of expertise was in the unrelated field of routine legal work and the selection of political appointees. Perhaps Ingram is sensitive about his lack of qualifications for his job and afraid he might look bad in trying to justify his errant decisions. Perhaps hes they simply cant be justified and he knows it. Knight says, Well, there you go. That should tell you something. People concerned about elections being rigged, youve got the Director of Elections here in the Secretary of States office that wont talk to us. He takes one look at the press and turns around an walks off. Knight notes in the video that it was his intention to ask Ingram why there have been so many orders to contravene the law that would give us an audit trail for electronic voting machines. He points out the concerns of the American people over the integrity of our electoral process and notes that Weve seen time and time again that the director here of elections has judged in favor of the vendors rather than in favor of integrity. Knight says, If the vendors machines that he wants to buy dont conform to election law they change the election laws. So we want to ask him why hes shutting down paper trails at the different precincts, why they are turning away monitors at the elections and other issues about electronic voting that many people are concerned about. It is a nationwide concern and were going to ask him what he can tell us to reassure voters that these elections are not rigged. Rather than offer reassurances, Ingram increased our concerns, indicating that he cant explain his actions and that they may well have been done specifically with the intent to manipulate the results. Hes supposed to be a public servant, apparently that doesnt include nosey reporters trying to inform the American people. In those cases he feels justified in running and hiding. Combine his behavior with the illegal alien hordes being allowed to vote and weve got a very serious situation, one that could easily see this election stolen by the establishment thugs.

2,"Report On Harm Caused By Edward Snowden Blows Up British Foreign Secretary Philip Hammond said Snowden had done a huge amount of damage to the Wests ability to protect its citizens. As to the specific allegations this morning, we never comment on operational intelligence matters so Im not going to talk about what we have or havent done in order to mitigate the effect of the Snowden revelations, but nobody should be in any doubt that Edward Snowden has caused immense damage, he told Sky News. Across the pond, on Sunday, June 14, the Britain Sunday Times published a blockbuster report available by subscription that claimed Great Britains MI6 was forced to pull spies and operatives out of the field for their protection. On the surface, the claim seems plausible. Every report on the encrypted files that Edward Snowden had on the laptop he stole says that the theft caused immense damage and irreparable harm to intelligence operations conducted by western powers. The problem in Great Britain as of this writing is that the reporters who have been following the story are calling foul and the story itself is being rewritten without retractions. A number of falsehoods that have been reported over the last two years and later retracted without widespread publicity were repeated in the story. The two specific things mentioned are that the American National Security Agency cannot confirm that 1.7 million files were downloaded, and that Glenn Greenwalds boyfriend did not visit Snowden at any time and bring 58,000 documents to London. Both are listed as facts in the Sunday Times piece. To put it mildly, its a journalism nightmare. American news wire service Reuters picked up the story, as did several others. The concept that the information leaked to whoever Snowden handed it to caused intelligence operations to cease hit headlines and started to trend globally on social media. And yet, the initial stories on the debacle are being amended on a rolling basis, and other reporters are busy pointing out contradictions. [Glenn] Greenwald, one ofthe journalists who first broke news ofthe files and was part of the team that won a Pulitzer Prize for reporting on Snowdens NSA revelations, said the Times article was filled with falsehoods. Greenwald wrote on the The Intercept, the news website he co-founded,that the article gives voice to banal but inflammatory accusationsthat are made about every whistleblower from Daniel Ellsberg to Chelsea Manning. It offers zero evidence or confirmation for any of its claims, he writes. The journalistswho wrote itneither questioned any of the official assertions nor even quoted anyone who denies them. Its pure stenography of the worst kind. The thrust of Greenwalds piece and thus the other journalistic criticism is that the Sunday Times piece offered no evidence on the word of anonymous sources to make their claim. That does not mean that it is not true, just that Greenwald and other journalists see such reports as being propaganda of sorts, and to an extent a smear campaign against Edward Snowden. Doubt is thrown on the thought that Russia and China could crack the code on American encryption when American government servers have been hacked by the Chinese twice in the last month. Especially since all the reporters claim that the laptop was handed over to REPORTERS in Hong Kong, not any government. None offered any information on where it is now other than saying Snowden claims he destroyed his copy of the files. (Waitthere was a copy? Just one?) As the British Home Office put it, Vladimir Putin didnt grant Edward Snowden asylum for nothing. It wasnt simply that his American passport had been revoked. That source did claim that assets on the ground were targeted, but again no names and no evidence. Almost as if this entire exercise was a black hole covert operation. Imagine that. The thing is, Britain is having a debate on surveillance just as the United States is and legislation is pending, and the timing of the report is awfully convenient. No matter where one stands on Edward Snowdens actions hero or traitor, narcissist or whistleblower there is no doubt that secrets and covert operational details made it to the hands of western adversaries in addition to information on metadata spying programs. That fact is inevitable, and every western intelligence official interviewed has said so in no uncertain terms. However, there is no evidence of anyone being harmed. At least none that is presented. That seems to be the point the critics of the Sunday Times report. The only thing that can be said, is that in the race for headlines and becoming the next Woodward and Bernstein, a lot of corners are being cut. Journalism is the rough draft of history. It takes a while for the real story to shake out. What that is in this case may not be any of the above. ",3
2,"Liberty, Security, Privacy, Big Brother, and the Concept of the Common Good The outrage is palpable and the increasing realization by the average American that they really, truly are now living in an Orwellian surveillance state has been an eye-opening experience for many across the fruited plain. The once mocked conspiracy theory of the all-knowing Big Brother state has shown itself to be far more of an ugly reality than a silly fantasy. He who called the War on Terror basically over has now been forced to admit that his administration has vastly expanded the concept of the security state in the name of public safety. The trust us stance of government is no longer a working defense for such actions as this administration, and the federal agencies under its control, have shown that they simply cannot be trusted. Therein lies the true dilemma for the Obama administration as it seeks to calm the rising storm. We already have proof that powerful agencies of the federal government deliberately, under orders from Washington, harassed and targeted specific people and groups that were ideological opponents of the current administration. The vast powers of the state were used as political weapons against its enemies on a wide scale and possibly affected the outcome of the last presidential election. Such things should not be taken lightly. The fact that basically every phone call, Facebook post, internet search, website visit, email written, and picture posted online is being sucked up by Big Brother without regards to privacy concerns, constitutional protections, or the concept of personal liberty goes against everything America should stand for. It is state of affairs that should raise a cry of outrage in every throat and force a fundamental change in what we will tolerate from our government. The fact that leading tech companies including Microsoft, Yahoo, Google, Facebook, PalTalk, AOL, Skype, YouTube and Apple were participating in a secret surveillance program on the citizenry known as PRISM should (but will not necessarily) lead to a complete collapse of public trust in the current administration and our current concept of government in general. What has not been explained away is why the administration has assembled the most powerful and intrusive systems of surveillance ever conceived. The Founding Fathers would not have stood for such things for one second and neither should we. Such policies can have a chilling effect on political speech and free speech in general. There are those who argue that liberals have successfully seized the State just as they have academia, education, the media, the entertainment industry and increasingly the military. And this may be just another tool and tactic for those seeking to monitor, track, and eventually silence those who oppose their utopian, socialistic, nanny-state agenda. Mr. Obama stated I think its important to recognize that you cant have 100 percent security and also then have 100 percent privacy and zero inconvenience. Were going to have to make some choices as a society. But if it comes down to a choice between the two I choose privacy. We should always, always choose a free state over a police state even if the latter provides slightly more security from the random Boston bomber or occasional crazy. As Americans we should not be forced to live with a camera on every pole, a bug in every phone, and an internal security officer on every corner. That illusion of safety in reality then merely becomes the mask for eventual tyranny and oppression in the name of the common good and societal safety. For as Ben Franklin put it, Those who would give up essential Liberty, to purchase a little temporary Safety, deserve neither Liberty nor Safety. Liberty should be the goal of government, not the antithesis of it. The Republic exists to secure such liberties for its citizens, not to be the opponent of such. Weve now traveled far down the wrong path and we may have to pay a high price to restore the Republic and regain true liberty for our children, and our childrens children. ARVE Error: Element ID could not be build, please report this bug. And frankly, you are right Mr. President. The fact that we cant trust you, your cronies, the agencies under your control, and the oversight of stacked secret courts or the Congress who has been complaining, but doing nothing, about such policies means we are going to have some serious problems.

2,"Conservatives propose divided New York ALBANY, N.Y. Probably not since the Civil War has America seemed so divided as it is nowwith conservatives and liberals vying to shape the nations future. So, some New York conservatives are proposing to cut up the state along those lines into upstate and downstate largely self-governing regions. The November elections showed how strong feelings can run even in a normally blue state such as New York. Here, the more conservative upstate region overwhelmingly voted for Republican-Conservative Rob Astorino for governor. But upstate was trumped mostly by the strongly liberal and densely populated New York City and downstate counties. Liberal Andrew Cuomo was reelected governor for a second term. A number of disappointed conservatives are reportedly flocking to help push a proposal that would divide New York into upstate and downstate autonomous regions while retaining a token state governmentNew Amsterdam and New York respectively. Its going better than I thought it would be at this time, said John Bergener, who leads the New Amsterdam project. Bergener, co-coordinator of the Capital Region chapter of the Upstate Conservative Coalition, said the project website, http://www.newamsterdamny.org/, is being bombarded by more inquiries and potential volunteers than can be quickly processed. But more volunteers will lead to more volunteers, and besides that, media interest in the project has grown, he said. The website got more than 50,000 hits within a week and a half after the election. Conservatives and independents turned out in droves at the November elections against Cuomos policies and, no doubt, President Barack Obamas reign. Cuomo won with downstate and a few upstate counties, but by a slimmer margin now than four years ago. The son of the late former Gov. Mario Cuomo, Cuomo took only eight upstate counties while Astorino got 42 counties. Four years earlier, Cuomo won 37 upstate counties, and Republican Carl Paladino captured only 13. Cuomo defeated Astorino 54 percent to 41 percent statewide, but he beat Paladino 63 percent to 33 percent. Astorino is a former twice-elected Westchester County executive who cut spending and taxes. Gun rights, the state economy and regulations, Common Core, fracking, school choice, and life and marriage issues were some of the points in contention. The rationale of the New Amsterdam project is that upstate, which constitutes most of the state, is generally conservative with moderate liberalism mixed in and consists of small- to medium-size communities in rural and suburban settings. Downstate, which, in the plan, includes New York City in a total of nine counties, is much more liberal. So New Amsterdam would include all counties except New York, Westchester, Suffolk, Bronx, Kings, Queens, Richmond, Nassau and Rockland. In a nutshell, the plans involves a token state government limited to a 3 percent sales tax with an executive, legislature and judiciary and such agencies and laws that would apply statewide. Each autonomous region would have the same three-part structure as the state and agencies that would deal with three-fourth of the laws. Regional legislators also would be in the state legislature. Adoption of the plan requires amending the state constitution either by the state legislature passing the amendment twice, with an election of legislators in between, and putting it before the voters in 2017, or the people voting for a constitutional convention in 2017, as they are entitled to do by law. The New Amsterdam team will call on the public to ask county boards and state legislators to support an amendment. The main rationale is economics because upstate is being killed by high taxation, overregulation, unfunded mandates, bureaucracy and duplication, Bergener said. That includes regulations which apply to one region but not to the other, or are outdated. What we are trying to do is to give more power to the people at the local level, he said. Historically, such proposals to divide a state into regions or more states rarely gain traction. This time last year, this seemed like a pie-in-the-sky idea, but since the election the proposal seems like a viable option, Bergener said. Im 100% in support of secession !! The time is right ! ",4
2,"11 Year Old Boy Being Changed Into Girl In California- Sex Change Procedures On Children... I am not condoning people doing harm to anyone, in fact, I am arguing for the protection of children. They too often become victims to the liberal-sponsored depravity thats running rampant in America. Children are the least equipped to protect themselves and the most vulnerable members of our society. To ignore the crimes against them which are being endorsed and facilitated by the State is inexcusable. The dictionary says: Child Abuse has been defined as an act, or failure to act, on the part of a parent or caretaker that results in the death, serious physical or emotional harm, Sexual Abuse, or exploitation of a child, or which places the child in an imminent risk of serious harm (42 U.S.C.A. 5106g). I am going to focus on the issue of physical and emotional harm, as well as the sexual abuse issue. I am not an attorney or a medical professional. From the looks of things, too many professionals have had the common sense driven completely out of them by the institutions of higher learning and had it replaced with their new definitions of what is normal, acceptable, reasonable and beneficial. There is an eleven year old boy in Berkley, CA, Thomas Lobel, who has had the misfortune to have been adopted by a couple of lesbian women who, in what may be their own little act of revenge upon the male gender, are transforming a defenseless little boy into a girl. Thomas is undergoing a controversial hormone blocking treatment which will prevent him from going through puberty as a boy, although his boy genitalia will still be there in a diminished form. Great for him, he wont be a boy, wont be a girl, but will definitely be different. That is just what you want to do to a kid who is trying to navigate the landscape of growing up. Put obstacles and self-doubt into his path. They have justified their actions through the perverse idea that he will inevitably have to make the transition, so why not just get it over with. The younger the better, they argue, hell be less likely to want to kill himself if hes allowed to turn into a girl. That rationale should be enough to make them take a pause in and of itself. Emotional harm is one of the criteria for child abuse. If you contribute to the damage of a childs psyche intentionally, to such an extent that you are concerned for the childs potential suicidal response, you are probably doing something wrong to that child. Changing a physically normal boy into a hybrid does not eliminate the risk of suicide. In fact, an increased risk of suicide would seem to be a likely outcome. Raising a well adjusted boy with the proper physical equipment to handle daily life seems a more preferable alternative. Rather than encourage manliness and educate the boy as to what it means to be a man, they engage in the self-gratification of their lifestyle preference by proxy. Does vanity demand that the boy be sacrificed for the sake of their in-vogue lesbian activism and new-found fame as neighborhood celebrities? Perhaps, if the Gender Distortion agenda werent in charge of so much of the court, judicial, educational and medical professions, this kind of perversion upon an innocent child wouldnt be permitted, much less encouraged in the lunatic preserve that is California, and the San Francisco Bay area. I dont care what two adults do between the two of them. I believe in personal liberty and personal liberty begins at home. I do care when you extend that freedom into an attack on innocents, such as a child, in the name of promoting an agenda. In my opinion, (and this is my article) that is what is being done here by the State of California through this morally, if not statutorily criminal act. They are sacrificing this child in the name of their demented version of the common good and the furtherance of their leftist agenda. The liberal agenda is anti-natural, anti-traditional and especially anti-God. So any acts in which they can insert themselves into the equation as a replacement for any or all of these components are irresistibly attractive to them. With their actions in this case, the State has hit a grand slam. People are afraid to speak up. They fear they will be judged as intolerant, name called, or ridiculed. I am not afraid. I dont care what a perpetrator of evil thinks of me. I dont care that my position upon an issue is known. Those who are unable to speak for themselves need other voices to speak on their behalf. Silence for the sake of political correctness or tolerance doesnt extend to the abuse of children. At that point it becomes cowardliness. Once this boy is an adult, he is in a position to make this decision for himself. Before then, it is wrong, no matter what label you attach to it. No infacti was raised by my mother And when left my grandmother but i was raised doing things that boys do and had other males in my life doing what guys do and learn. if there are no males in his life then he will have no other view point. Until he is allowed and shown relife. To do this sex change is a crime . He will have no idea who he is until hes atleast 20. He was born a male a should be treated as one until he is old enough to decide otherwise that is an illusion too many people feel is correct. I had men throughout my life that I could look up to and at as a good role model, people raise children all the time without one or the other parent just fine and in most cases the child comes out as good or better than if the other parent had been in their life. Claiming a certain parental type MUST be in the picture is blinding yourself to truth that bigotry is behind your feelings of hate towards anyone that doesnt fit your particular mould. They should ha e adopted a girl if that was what they want wanted.. At 11 years old he is still a baby .. Even if it was his choice at 11 he is y legal def. A child an could not make legal decision for such a procedure For them to make this choicefor him is unthinkable. CHILD SERVICES red to do their job Same sex parenting is an anti-social construct, regardless of what your excuse for it is. Because it takes away the rights of the child to have a mother AND a father. So if you want to talk about rights, what about the rights of that child? Homosexuals, if serious about their compassion, would never utilize a child as a trophy or a statement to promote their sexual preference. Heres my problem with this post and homosexuals in general. They have to make a big, public display out of their sexuality. I mean, honestly, who the %$#@ cares? Who would care if Tom Cruise held a press conference and declared that he was a raging heterosexual? NO ONE! The ONLY reason that homosexuals flaunt their lifestyle on TV, in print, in parades, in court and in the public eye, is to shove it down our throat. Ohus poor homosexualswe are treated so badly. Oh really? Homosexuals have just as many rights and privileges as heterosexuals do. In fact, MORE! Burn an American flag and you get a pass burn a rainbow flag and a million homosexuals are screaming, discrimination! They wont be happy unless the entire planet conforms to THEIR way of thinking and living. And as for the asinine and imbecilic quote about the religious reaction, wake up! Homosexuals have been blaming their inherent persecution from society on religion as a whole for decades, when in fact, the vast majority of religions condemn the homosexual lifestyle but do not expend their time, energy or resources on hate campaigns the way numerous homosexual organizations like GLADD do. Yes, there definitely are some professed religionists that take things into their own hands and scream that God should smite the homosexuals, but those clowns are not representative of ALL religions. In other words, dont be so idiotic as to shoot ALL the dogs just because a few have fleas. And as for me, dont tell me that I hate homosexuals simply because I refuse to condone their way of life. I dont hate them, I hate their actions. Theres a monumental difference. I just find it unnatural that a man would insert his reproductive organ into a body cavity of another man a body cavity that is intended for use as a discharge area for bodily waste. It is a biological fact that the homosexual lifestyle is conducive to the spread of life threatening diseases by that very act alone. And dont fault me because I find a physical relationship with a woman much more appealing than snuggling up to a guy with a hairy back and a 5 oclock shadow. So, lets call it like it is! Homosexuals are truly HETEROPHOBIC! exactly Perfect argument!! Hes not old enough to know what he wants. I suppose you support pedophilia for all the same reasons. In fact. Yeah I see them all here posting in protest, dont you? Not if you sewed em shut. I think they WANT to be sexless. how about you? A child that age doesnt have ANY sex. Equipment. yes, but thats like having a car but no gas. Since you admit to your generation being fucked up, this is getting circular, isnt it? Apparently Carol cant read.. What world do you live in? It was obvious to me Is there no one who can petition the courts on that kids behalf? These ladies simply hate men and anything to do with it. I dont give a hoot if my entire neighborhood is filled with fags as long as they leave me alone and practice their disgusting sexual flritation in their own homes. I wont try to recruit them and they sure as hell should not try to recruit me or my family. Solitary confinement sounds like a good idea for these two. Yeah, he looks happy THIS NEEDS TO BE STOPPED. THIS IS HORENDOUS. IS THIS WHAT OUR WORLD HAS BEEN TURNED IN TO. A) This is what the child wants. You would know that if youd have researched past one article. B) If her male hormones are allowed to develop completely, its extremely more dramatic of a change, so shes at a perfect age to make this decision. C) The transphobic author of this article is clearly biased, something no journalist should exhibit when reporting news. The hateful language used here is appalling. How do you people live with yourselves harboring do much hate? Unless this kis has expressed gender identity disorder from a young age, and most kids know, this is absolutely unacceptable and should be reported to authorities. You dont just mess with a persons gender identity because you think its trendy. This is such a load of horseshit Im surprised nobody has called this out. Are we sure that this is even a true story? Or is it propaganda? Single mothers almost always have a male role model in the childs life. Uncle, grandfather, estranged dad. So you are wrong. damo hit it on the head Liberalism is a mental illness THIS RIGHT HERE is why same sex couples SHOULD NOT BE ALLOWED TO ADOPT CHILDREN!!!!! Is this article for real. Very true..God does NOT MAKE MISTAKES.He created male and female. Marriage is between a man and a woman. Very well said, Sharon Jackson.. And we actually know nothing about the child. They may not be showing any female tendencies at all but because the mothers have an agenda are forcing this on him, or it may be the childs choice. In my opinion its too young to be given any sort of hormones or hormone blockers either way. Its people like you tho that make children feel like they cant like certain things or act a certain way because it doesnt match their gender. Yes because every single mothers son has turned out to be gay or not manly Its not just a couple that raises a child its a society. He may have male influences at school, on tv. My mother grew up without a father and turned to mr Rodgers. And what are female tendencies? You shouldnt limit childrens interests, thats when they start to get confused. A boy that likes dolls may feel like he has to become gay or a girl because its a girl thing when in reality studies have been shown that boys who play with dolls made better fathers. I saw a video by dove once that was about doing things like a girl and the end message was that being a woman wasnt a negative thing. He is a CHILD you idiot ! He needs help not mutilation !!! How in this rotten world can anyone let those twisted creatures ruin a poor little boys life before he even knows what is going on ??? God please help this child ! PLEASE somebody take this child away before his whole life is destroyed !! That boy maybe showing the female tendencies because there are no males in his life to show him how to be a boy or man. A woman cannot raise a boy to be a man without a an in his life just as two gay man cannot raise a girl to be a woman , it is just not possible. Hes serving their personal agendas. What evil these poor excuse for parents are. What did they do to this poor boy to make him think such a way at a young age? You rarely see gay male parents do this but lesbians do and you see many examples of them doing this in the media. Poor kid. Evil male hating women. And when he/she is 20 they will want us tax payers to support him/her financially and pay for the reversal. Idiots! Christians and Muslims agree on this. Hmmmm, I wonder what group we see pushing this sort of progressive nonsense do a google search for his name, you will find many videos and articles on the subject, and please do some research before you make your assumption of sick and twisted The child is only being given puberty blocking medications, If the child and the therapist feel that it is appropriate, they can be stopped and they will go through puberty as a normal boy, It isnt permanent by any means just yet, surgeries arent given to children even with the parents approval these days. From what Ive read, they cant until at the very least 17 and usually not even then unless a parent signs off Most states and countries require over 18, lots of therapy prior to surgery, minimum of a year living in the gender they plan on changing to as well as a length of time on hormones. It isnt an easy decision to come to and I wouldnt recommend it myself. The only warped opinions Ive been seeing in this thread are those of all the people blaming the lesbian couple for changing this child when this child is the one that told them (they didnt ask her what she was) that she is a girl Many people abuse children that exhibit gay or transgender tendencies, verbally, physically, sexually, mentally if there is an abomination going on, it would be on the part of people calling for the arrest, assault, murder, abuse, prosecution, or whatever to these loving parents many kids would love to have a pair of parents to love them unconditionally, and thats what these two are doing. so lets see that means you support stoning your daughter for disobeying you? submitting to your husbands punishment for talking to another man, selling your daughter into slavery? then we can continue with all the other sins listed in the bible, like wearing clothes of two different fabrics, eating shellfish, pork, etc etc etc your argument is 110% invalid based on the multitude of passages in the bible that tell people to love one another. He never said anything about love one another unless he or she loves someone of the same sex, or if he changes into a girl HIS love is totally unconditional and asks HIS children to do the same The operation youre referring to isnt even available till after the transgender individual is of age, and even hormone blockers arent given till after therapists have had much time with the individual to determine a proper course to take with them. Learn something about what youre talking about BEFORE making assumptions on something like this one photo doesnt describe a persons life by any means. That child has loving parents, many have killed their children, born of their own bodies because they exhibited transgender or gay tendencies If I adopted a child, only to then sacrifice him in some religious ritual, Id be charged.whats the difference with these twothey have sacrifice this child to the god of their own sexuality. very very well said! I have several gay relatives. I love each and every one of them. But I cannot agree that it is a normal lifestyle. Our bodies were made to be male and female I , for one, cannot understand how two men having sexual relations in their butts is normal. God made us male and female. There is a great evil prevailing in this country. Since many have turned their backs on God (Jesus) we have continued a downhill slide into destruction of all the values the Bible taught. We are certainly in the last days. Did you just run with the fact that they are lesbians and changing a boy to a girl? Did you interview them at all? Do you know anything of that Childswants? are you just another Christian doing things that only directly benifit you? Being Christian and turning your nose up to everything your suppose to believe and do? Next time interview them dont just publish your onesided opinion, thats how we get bad journalism. so true! and so very sad. Many become lesbians because of sexual abuse they endured as a child. If they were abusing him i.e. physically etc he would have been taken away is this any different? so very sad for this child who has apparently no say in this decision by two warped people. In a way it reminds me of the story of the young man who had his penis burnt off by a doctor who circumcised him and was turned into a girl. He later committed suicide. Wish I could take this kid home with me and let him live a SAFE and NORMAL life. Why manufacture queers? Dont we already have enough? i HATE california.it used to be the envy of the rest of the states until the liberals put it in the toilet! and stupid californians voted AGAINST gmo labeling and keep voting in the same destructive legislators. in any other state, this child would have been REMOVED from ABUSIVE PARENTS. whatever. your part of the problem No one can change another persons mind, habits, inclinations, or practices, except that person, himself. As a health care provider I agree with everything you have written. This child is too young to have an opinion that is truly his own and would be able to be swayed by the environmental influence that surrounds him. These so called parents seem to have an agenda which do not include the consideration of this childs emotional, physical, and spiritual immaturity and vulnerability. I am appalled and horrified that this is allowed to happen. I generally believe that adults can do whatever they want and have always supported guy rights, but this is an abomination. The ONLY way this would be considered if this child was born with both male and female sex organs and assigned at birth the wrong sex. This should not be considered for a healthy male child, operative word is child. Sad daythese two adults should have adopted a little girl if that is what they wanted to raise. Has anybody Snooped this? This cant be true, even for the whack jobs in CA. This has to fall under the same law that an adult can not have sex with a child, even if the child consents. They dont know any better and we as a society have to protect the children from predictors like these so called parents. The Bible states homosexuality is an abomination in the sight of God and a sin and no matter what preacher or anybody else you listen to who tries to tell you differently, if the Bible states its wrong, its wrong. Practicing homosexuals will not be allowed into heaven. You wont know what hell on earth is until you miss the rapture and have to go through the Tribulation. THEN, youll have a clue Unfortunately supposition wont gain anything. The fact of the matter is this person is being influenced by the opinions of his guardians, physically altered to match their ideals, and permanently changed at a very early age changes which likely cant be reversed. I believe this boy has been told that men are evil and abusive all his life. What kind of boy who loves his parents would want to become the very beast that they hate so much? If you think they happened to have a son with this condition you are retarded. They brought that anguish upon him. Gay couples should not be allowed to adopt. PERIOD! They are going to automatically transfer their beliefs to a child whether that child is confused or not. A child should not be allowed to have any type of sex change until said child is 18 years of age. Yeah, but youd have to put them in solitary confinement else theyd just have lesbian sex parties in prison. lets abort these two NOW! It is really really really too bad that you allow your ignorance of the subject to taint your writings without doing the research. You succeed in promoting hate and ignorance with your ignorance. So many points are wrong but it would take effort on your part to learn instead of just judging what you have read. You laziness and ignorance is unbelieveable. The boy is adopted and these two women want to change him.BO! Where are the Child Protective Services to stop this. If he wants to change then let him do it at 21. I also would say to get him AWAY from these (my opinion) FREAKS! They have an agenda. Any judge with any sense would stop this interference with nature. These nasty ,overweight dykes are freaky enough and now they want to create a freaky kid ? Makes me sick. I believe that people should be able to have sex changes but only after they are 18. Hormones do a lot of things to a persons body and can make them feel different ways, no permanent changes like this should be made at this time. To generalize lesbian parents and liberals because of what these people are doing is a bit like me saying that all conservative white males have a Nazi agenda. What these people are doing IS wrong and yes they do happen to be liberals but you have to realize the absurd things that right-wingers have done such as chaining a black male to their pick up truck, dragging him and killing him simply for being black. Please stop blabbing about god, if you want to follow your gods rules then do it but dont try to condemn others for not. You.. are what will bring hell to this earth not someone loving another of the same sex. Not every gay lesbian or trans person would do thia to the poor child. In fact I without a doubt know all of my gay/les/trans friends would be appalled at this happening. This is political correctness gone haywire. Only in California (where I live, sadly) would such a ridiculous and detrimental procedure been done on a helpless child. These two women are guilty of child abuse. I just watched a documentary on PBS about the importance of recognizing the differences between men and women when it comes to diseases and the medications we take for them. Men and women have different symptoms to heart attacks, strokes, and various forms of cancer. Certain meds and treatments work better on men than women and visa versa. This is important scientifically proven facts, and all this gender bending nonsense can affect the future health of this poor child and others who think they are in the wrong body. You can do all kinds of surgery and hormone replacement, but you cannot change the chromosomes or DNA of a person. This is not only wrong, it is morally despicable. Sexual deviants should not be allowed to adopt children, PERIOD. This is child abuse and sex abuse and I cant understand how any sane person would listen to a three year old and then follow through with such drastic measures. This child should be removed from these two. Theres nothing more to say except You got it all correct Joe and commenters in agreement. Its simply depressing. No child should have any procedure done that would require them to be of age of sexual consent, even if the parents say okay. Im sorry, if we can prosecute a 17 yr old boy for having sex with his 16 yr old girlfriend because she was not of the age of consent, then a child should have no sexually altering medication or surgery before he is of age of consent. If a woman has a right to choose to give birth or not, then a child has all rights pertaining to their body as well. The parents should lose their child. This child doesnt even have adult hormones yet and they want to change them? Only in California and any doctor who would authorize this is more insane than the poor people he/she treats. I think for the most part psychiatrists are not too sane themselves. Everything cannot be handled by talking or a pill and in the whole, the practice has led us to the number of deviant and violent people in society today. They pass off their personal warped opinions as gospel and the uninformed listen and follow. WTF??? Someone needs to take this child away from these SADISTS. Where are Child Protection Services when thay are needed? These women need to ROT in Hell!!! No child at 11 years old has the maturity or knowledge to be making those kinds of decisions or even be influenced towards those types of decisions. These women should be shot and the child adopted out to DECENT and GOOD people, not worthless idiots! All of this nonsense all of it has been brought to us by radical liberalism and its hate filled philosophy. those two old hags need to be locked up nasty assed dykes Im a strong, conservative Christian, but I am about to taint my testimony, of sorts: This frickin PISSES ME OFF!!! How in the WORLD did these lesbo, sexually-perverse, man-hating psychos adopt this BOY??? Obviously, these women have mental issues! There should be a law. The law is that no one can have a sex change operation until they are 18, which is a legal adult. If the person is serious about a sex change it wont be legal until 18. This gives the person time to really think about it and decide if they want it and can decline if it is being pushed on them by parents. Some parents feel they know best and may push a child toward a certain lifestyle that the child doesnt want. If we can make a child wait until 18 to get a tattoo we can make a child wait until they get their genitalia cut off or altered permanently. I am a Republican but I am for free choice. I dont mind gay marriage between two adults. I just dont think these kind of decisions should be made by under aged people or parents of under aged people. If a 18 year old wants to have a sex change operation then it is their choice. Live and let live. Not the Republican you expected huh? I believe in free choice, only God can judge. Where are the B.A.U. (Criminal Minds), when their needed. Child Abuse at its finest hour. There is a hot place in hell waiting for these cunts. A lot of kids at that age have gender issues. My daughter did. It doesnt mean the want to be turned into something they are not. My daughter wanted to be a boy at 10-11. She is now in her 30s married with children and happy being a woman! No doubt they have pushed this on the kid. These man haters have probably made this kid feel like dirt for being a boy so to please them he claims he wants to be a girl. Looks to me they are taking a normal kid and screwing him up royally. More proof that homosexuals should never be allowed to adopt. Bottom line is, you cannot change DNA. He is MALE, and will ALWAYS BE MALE. nasty these women should be charged with child abuse and he should be taken away from them lock them up and throw away the key! One unhappy lookin kid, those clam slammers need thrown in prison and introduced to mr. broomstick. Anyone wish to LEAVE GOD? Move to California! What a shame! You missed the point apparently, by saying I have things backward if I thought this was Gods work. I just said it wasnt God that made a mistake, it is something humans are doing to change the fetus in the womb. We dont know what, but we can accept the child for who they are. Its a physical thing in the brain, in the receptors. Theres no cure for that. Believe me, your description of yourself as a child is NOTHING like a transgender child goes throughtrust me on that. I know. Ive had personal experience. You cant compare it. You can try, but you cant, and you really, really dont know. They do NOT change their minds or decide oops, I made a mistake, can I go back and change my mind? That is not a transgendered person if they do. There is a BIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGG difference between being a tomboy, and being transgendered. Sorry you dont understand, but I challenge you to start getting to know some transgendered children, be a part of their lives every single day for years and see what it is like for them. I really do challenge you to educate yourself on how they are. Youd be in for a big surprise on how difficult it is and how it doesnt change because you wish it away. It just doesnt. So, please, go right ahead. Please. Go find out. Seriously, I am not joking. Go try to change them and force them to feel the way you think they should. Ive been there, done that. I finally had to let go and decided it was better to stop pushing and trying to force someone into a mindset that wasnt happening than to see someone I love kill themselves. When I was a kid I wanted to be a boy. I didnt appreciate dresses, having to sit on the toilet to pee, or playing with dolls. I liked cars, army men, and shooting things. For halloween I dressed up as peter pan and came home from school crying because everyone thought I was tinkerbell. I wasnt like typical girls and that was okay. I was allowed to be whatever i wanted to be but that didnt mean I should have been a boy. I went though phases, and I thank God that I didnt have parents dumb enough to even consider hormone therapy. They let me be a kid I couldnt have possibly known what or who I should be for the rest of my life. Their job was to help me find myself, to guide me when I misbehaved and so much more. Only extreamly sick people would allow a child to make that kind of a decision. I cant imagine what my life would have been, had I been changed into anything other than who i am today. What these women are doing is abuse, and it cannot be undone.Our culture has accepted two huge lies. The first is that if you disagree with someones lifestyle, you must fear or hate them. The second is that to love someone means you agree with everything they believe or do. Both are nonsense. You dont have to compromise convictions to be compassionate. Supporting this sad story, is supporting abuse. You cant tell me there arent better and less radical ways to deal with this. Anyone who believes this is Gods work, has things backward. This is perverse and unfortunately life altering for this poor child- at the ripe old age of 11. Goodness overcomes evil and these people need a lot of prayer and love. When I was a kid I wanted to be a boy. I didnt appreciate dresses, having to sit on the toilet to pee, or playing with dolls. I liked cars, army men, and shooting things.

You are right about one thing People make mistakes not God. Being gay isnt something that comes from God, it comes from evil. Its not our job (as Gods children) to judge, our job is to love everyone. Supporting this nonsense is supporting abuse. Our culture has accepted two huge lies. The first is that if you disagree with someones lifestyle, you must fear or hate them. The second is that to love someone means you agree with everything they believe or do. Both are nonsense. You dont have to compromise convictions to be compassionate. You have things backward if you think this is Gods work Dear Lord, Please get me out of this country before You visit fiery destruction upon it and its vile inhabitants. Yours truly, SlaveofChrist. Although I agree with the gist of your article, I disagree with you when you lump all of the people of California in one sentence much less encouraged in the lunatic preserve that is California. That is like saying everyone in California is a lunatic and, of course, that isnt true. There are a lot of people in California who feel the same way about this issue that you do. It is sad that an agenda of homosexuality exists in California, and particularly sad that those who champion that agenda have invaded the courts, pulpits, and schools. But to generalize that all people in California are lunatics is not the answer. This story only states a persons opinion. There isnt a doctor in the world that would change a childs sex based on just what the parents want if there wasnt a medical reason. If there is such a doctor, he would be crucified by the judicial system. So I say, there is more to this story than what this writer claims. Just who the hell is the sick god playing SOB that is the DR??????? He should have his Medical license pulled now. And jailed for abuse to an 11 yr old child. I dont believe all the hormones are adjusted at 11 yrs old. When I was 11 I was a tom boy.. Am i sure glad all this sick crappy sex change stuff wasnt around then. I like being female. How is it made worse? As long as the child is happy and agrees, I dont see the problem. If you have a serious issue about it, dont look at it. If you dont want this to happen to your child, then dont have your child go threw this type of procedure. The chromosomes may not change due to the fact that our medical science isnt that far advanced along, yet. The child will not have any mental issues considering this will not cause anything genetic to happen. If the child would happen to develop mental issues, they would of developed them no matter what gender. Examples are depression and anxiety, those are typically learned or developed no matter what sex. Its commonly popular among females more so than males. Having a gender transplant will in no way, shape, or form affect the childs mental state unless assholes like you, sir (Or maam), affect that child in a negative way as so you have negatively shunned those forming sexual/mutual relationships with people who have sexual feelings towards the same sex. Do please take in mind that Im a 13-year-old pansexual female that is clearly knowing what Im talking about, assholes like you need to step it up and act like adults. Maybe then my generation wouldnt be as fucked up. **Excuse the profanity** Would any of you like to know what my 13 year old boy said about this? God doesnt make mistakes, but humanity has made a great many. Whos to say that these kids (and many older adults that hid through most of their lives) didnt have some kind of trauma when they were fetuses? Whos to say the mothers hormones while the fetus was growing didnt rewire things in the brain so that the brain turned out more masculine and the genitals came out the opposite? Whos to say chemicals, or fluoride (I know, a chemical, but a very specific and prevalent one), or leftover radiation in the ground in various areas of the country over time from decades ago nuclear testing right here in country, doesnt affect how a fetus develops over time because of the affects on the mother? Whos to say that drinking, or drugging, or stress, or any number of other factors didnt cause this kind of thing? Whos to say? No, God doesnt make mistakeswe as human beings do, and Lord knows what happens to various fetuses in utero because of we humans do outside of it while it grows? I mean, seriously. But we still have to deal with it. Its still there, and its still not going to go away no matter how much we wish it were so. These people dont have an agenda. They have a healthy understanding of what trans-children must be going through, and are trying to act accordingly. I know a trans child personally that was speaking of being the opposite sex from about 2 years old, no matter how hard grandparents and parents fought it. It wasnt anything in the social environment, and it certainly wasnt from being around any LGBT people, because there werent any in the picture, (P.S. social media hasnt been around for that long, and trans issues in regular media werent even a thing until recently, except maybe the movie Boys Dont Cry, and GOD, why would anyone get the idea they want to do that based on THAT movie the FTW transgendered person died!) You cant blame things like that. Transgendered people have been around, as I told someone else, since the dawn of history, we just dont accept it in our culture. Some cultures revere them as dual spirits and love them and dont question it. You really dont know much about it either, apparently. It is a very rare case when it happens out of the blue and usually one that can be healed with therapy, love and understanding, not surgery and mutilation. Uh, no its not a rare case. People in our country just didnt hear about it much because those people were shunned, hidden, hid themselves, and generally stuffed how they felt because they knew people would hate them for being different. That is really a very ignorant and innocent statement without basis of fact. The person I speak of was loved and therapied until it couldnt be fought anymore, because that person got so depressed it was dangerous. You really havent seen what its like, so you really cant know how very, very simplistic your ideal about how to cure them is. There is no cure Hon, and you really need to understand. You cant love it out of them. Curious if the boy would have turned out this way had he been adopted into a normal family. Curious if the boy would have turned out this way had he been adopted into a normal family. Yes, I wrote normal. Transgenders have been around for as long as history people in our society choose to ignore, hide from it, or berate it, but hey, there it is! Some cultures revere transgenders (or more appropriately, transsexuals) and love them for their dual spirit. My three year old thinks she is a turtle. Should I schedule the surgery now? How could a prepubescent boy definitively know that this is a decision they want to make altering the rest of their life. Is it not possible that seeing a mommy that plays the role of a daddy might have an effect on him? Two women are free to love each other, but when they f*#% up an adopted kid, someone should speak up on his behalf. This is horrifying! Wrong wrong wrong on every level!!! Any updatesthat means he is 15 now Heather did not support this sex change. Perhaps re read her post? Heathers post does not support this travesty, she comes down solidly against it. And arrested the lesbian degenerates. In this case, why does the state allow homosexual couples to adopt? This is a perversion promoting degenerates. When the values of miscreants dominate society the end cannot be far away. You got it! Pseudoscience psycho-babble is just what we get from the liberal head shrinks and their pseudo-professional association, the American Psychiatric Association. The real problem is the clueless approach to parenting that many new age adults exhibit. Parental selfishness and lack of common sense generate doubts in young children regarding sexuality and basic values. Then you see the desperate calls to the head shrinks and the ridiculous outcomes of more screwed-up kids. And . . . the lesbians need to be arrested, tried, and put away for a long time as an example to the rest of the miscreants out there. In a just society, the lesbian couple would be facing felony abuse charges with a 100% certainty guilty verdict and twenty years. The boy should be removed immediately from their control and receive extensive psychiatric care and real parents. Placing children with homosexual couples is a formula for very disturbed children with serious mental and behavior problems. Common sense and the lessons of thousands of years of human behavior seem to be difficult to find in legislatures and courts today. Nothing good comes from homosexuality and any authority awarding children to these perverts is also corrupt. When Western societies ignore Judeo-Christian values, societies become corrupt and degenerate to lawlessness. Geeee, kinda like . . . Obamas vision of America! how can any pf them make an objective and informed decision? The boy is too young to not be heavily influenced by his environment. This discusses it: Heres an actual news article: http://www.heraldsun.com.au/news/world/well-stop-puberty-so-tommy-can-become-tammy/story-e6frf7lf-1226169281540 He threatened to mutilate himself, thinking hes a girl. Here we go news article: Apparently hes been confused all his life, threatened to self-mutilate when he was 7, that was the start of this hormone blocking therapy. When hes 14 or 15 that will stop hell be allowed to choose if he wants to stay a boy (and hopefully get counseling so hes not confused) or be mutilated turned into an ersatz girl. The kid in the picture looks pretty miserable. Poor little boy. Id expect that there would be a court-appointed guardian to stand up for his interests well-being, before any doctor allowed him to take female hormones. So where is he? Why isnt he protecting the kid? Even taking the idea that he asked to be a girl, which it doesnt say in the article (do we have a link to a real news article anywhere?), children dont know. Theyre not capable of making big decisions like this. They cant understand the permanence long-term consequences of their actions. So unless its an older teen (16, 17) or an adult (18+) this sort of interference shouldnt be allowed. He is not transitioning. But no matter what they do, he will always remain genetically male. THE CHROMOSOMES DONT CHANGE!!! All you get is a mutilated male with life-long mental issues made worse by having his schlong chopped off. Surely there has to be a Christan or Jewish, Lawyer in the golden state this child has a right to be protected from these perverts . This is child abuse and the state should already have removed the boy from this home. This story reminds me of 2 things.Frankenstein, and Dr. Mengele It is downright sick and I assumed illegal for a parent to make this type of decision on a minor What the hell? CA had gone complete off the wall but this is proof that lawmakers and those involved in civil rights, truly need a 5150..someone get this child outta there before its too late. Pray prayers of intercession. the last few verses of Psalm 149 will do it. Bind them in fetters and irons, and proclaim the judgement written, to be executed before they can ruin this defenseless child. Psalm 149 1 Praise the Lord.[a] Sing to the Lord a new song, 2 Let Israel rejoice in their Maker; 6 May the praise of God be in their mouths Praise the Lord. I would send them to hell where they belong! Exactly! Who is to say he isnt waiting for the chance to do it? Heres a novel idea. Why dont this two perverts let the child grow up and decide what HE WANTS. He is only 11 years old. Nothing this stressful and dramatic should be thrust upon him. Even if he agrees, he is still a child. Let him be adopted by a normal family and then he can see what a real family is about. Then when he matures and has ALL of his male hormones and is fully developed, he can choose. Why would you want to neuter him now and then later he becomes a candidate for suicide because this life changing procedure was forced on him before he had a chance to develop his own mind and body. This is so appalling I cant imagine Childrens Services allowing this. But they are the same ones to give an abused child right back to those parents who unleased terrible physical and mental abuse to begin with. And, like the author saidthis is California and seems to be run by unicorns, moonbeams, and weed. Put the Two dyks in jail along with the dr. Giving them the drugs. After years what years he is 11 for gods sake maybe I am lost no where in the article did I read that this was his decision in fact I acttually got the opposite feel on the situation either way this is just sad and I dont think I have ever seen such a sick twisted case of mass hysteria Yeah, but we are taking about California so theres that. A Male child is not going to know that HE is a female. That excuse for sexual immortality has been used for centuries. These two women will pay a horrible price for what they are doing to this young boy. He is a child of God. God doesnt make mistakes. He made the boy a boy and thats all there is to it. A child does not know that they are another gender unless they are convinced so by an adult. This type of activity is what was going on in Sodom when God destroyed the city for no one in the city was found clean in their heart. He sent Angels who were attacked while there and they got Lot and his family out before God sent fire from Heaven and destroyed everyone in the city and the city itself. California is looking a lot like Sodom. This cannot be true?????????? If this is true and Im not saying it is not but this rings true to what Ive always knew would occur. Once you open pandoras box and let homosexuality out you will soon let out every other taboo known to man. this makes me sickGod will end this world soon enough and this homosexual agenda is what is entering the end of time in on us so fast already! Those selfish dykes. Any rational state would have taken that poor kid away from those man hating freaks The picture shows a very unhappy child. One, he may be unhappy because they are forcing him into having the operation. Two, if they wanted to raise a little girl, that is what they should have adopted. Honestly, I dont think they should be adopting anyone. A child is too young to have a procedure that would destroy who that person is. People are born male and female, and as previously stated will have that DNA. The child should be put with some loving parents, who will encourage him to be the best person God made him to be. If I was the boy Id have slashed both of those broads throats whie they were sleeping for even putting forth such an idea to start hacking on my parts. At 11 my record would be sealed and I could put it all behind me. Does that boy look happy about this to you??? the thing that really makes me sick is that fact that all these libtard idiots are actually ok with this happening! i dont care if the kid thinks he was born in the wrong body or not. what i want to know is how the hell does one know what its like to be in the right body? since, ya know, its so easy to change from body to body when you dont like the one youre born with. How to justify brutality? Call it a new name! You guys should all do research on this issue, from what Ive read is that Tammy always thought of herself as being a girl from an even younger age. I was honestly quite upset with this article at first thinking it was just a bunch of Man-hating dikes hating men, but it goes further than just what you read here. So go do some research first, if this was man hating dikes hating men I would approve of most of your comments, but the choice was made by the child after years of Tammy knowing she was a girl, its a disorder. Sick Puppies! need to be put down. This article is so old. Why are they reposting something from 2011? Is there anything current about this poor kid? Lots of things to address hereNot all of CPS is bad. When I was a CPS worker, my hands were often tied. I have also seen the dark side of CPS, so not all of us are saints either. Its a mixed group of people just like any other group, although I would say this particular group is VERY liberal (I didnt last long as a compassionate conservative in the group). Also, people need to understand that therapists are not ALLOWED to treat anyone sorting through gender issues with the assumption that they should remain the gender that they were born. Therefore, therapists are REQUIRED to explore and support the decisions made by their clientsthat is why you see highly competent Christian Psychologists leaving the APA. Now, lets follow the logic here. If an 11 year old is allowed to make this kind of major decision about their personality and sexuality, whos to say that they cant CHOOSE to have sex with a 40 year old? The vast majority of people would be mortified by that thought, but it is really not that different. My job as the single mother of three boys is to help them understand and accept their masculinity. Believe me, it has been a challenge for me, especially when I totally dont understand all of the rough housing and pissing matches that go along with emerging masculinity (and maleness in general sometimes). But there are a lot of fabulous things about men as well and those need to be celebrated and delighted in. Above all, this is a child who needs to be celebrated for both HIS masculinity AND femininity as the two in roughly equal amounts (by American standards) tend to coordinate with the most well adjusted and happiest people. If this child feels out of place now, just imagine how he will feel in the locker room with young men who have age appropriate penises and muscle tone, OR in the locker room with young women with developing breasts. Neither scenario sounds psychologically acceptable to me (a social worker and psychology grad student). Do I think CPS should intervene, yes, I do. We clearly have laws that state children are not capable of making sexual decisions for themselves. Do I think they will or that they can? No, there are not laws on the books that cover this and it would be a tremendously challenging case to win in court, especially in an area controlled by ultraliberal judges who are unlikely to rule against these parents. If nothing else, hopefully the law will be changed to address the damage done to ANY child by being allowed to make these kids of decisions far too early. Born in the wrong body!? What bs. It sickens me to hear any libtard try to justify this! Where I come from, boys were/are encouraged to be boys and girls the sameTHATS HOW ITS ALWAYS BEEN! And now that advanced medicine has regrettably figure out how to do the crap, you people thinks its ok because you have the right! Screw that! The parents need to be locked up and the boy needs to grow as nature intended. But by now the mental and physical damage from those 2 ignorant pos is probably permanent. Smh thank you libtards for helping degrade our country so much! Obama would be proud. maybe they should take these 2 women and turn them into men the ols saying if the shoe fits wear it there is no way the count system should let this happen and if the boy wants to be a lady later in life that should be his decision no one elses This issue on a whole is what is wrong with our great nation, what we have allowed it to become we are all so scared to stand up. who will stand for those that cannot stand for themselves. Who will sacrifice to set us down the path of nobility and grace. How has it come to this that we live in a nation where this is an issue. dumb feminists are f*** men castrating boys ruling the world still men dont unite There are many people born in to the wrong body. I have a friend that adopted a little boy. The child has gender issues, he believes he is in the wrong body yada, yada, yada This is the kind of pseudoscience psycho-babble B.S. that passes for mainstream psychiatric analysis these days! No wonder some kids today are so screwed up! People refuse to deal with reality! I am sorry but this is just wrong and what has become to accepted in our society. I will be called out on what I am about to say but I have to say it. Our gender is important, it is part of who we are it is who we are before we are born and after we leave this life. God does not make mistakes and to think he does and to change what he made us into is wrong. We have convinced ourselves in todays society that gender is simply a byproduct of the human condition and that it is something that can be cut away and changed on a whim. Society is wrong and it is crumbling all around us the more and more we accept this way of thinking. I dont believe any child just comes up with this theory on their own I think they are led to think this way either by social media or by the things they see in society. It is a very rare case when it happens out of the blue and usually one that can be healed with therapy, love and understanding, not surgery and mutilation. These women should be ashamed of themselves but then again they want to justify their lifestyle as well. Anything to destroy the traditional family will do in their book I am sure. Of course it would be California. http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-2043345/The-California-boy-11-undergoing-hormone-blocking-treatment.html this is exactly the reason not to let same sex couple adopt this kid will never EVER have a fair shot at life thanks to the dykes This is totally disgusting. .a child that young isnt old enough to make this kind of decisions. .I would tell the child to wait till he/she is 18 hoping the child came to their senses. Im sorry but God made him a boy an God doesnt make mistakes. Just look at the poor little guys face he is not happy about this at all. It is obvious to me that his thoughts and feelings are not being considered at all. All so these two sickos force their perverted lifestyle onto him. God did not intend it to be this way and thing that is against the natural order is perversion. BULLS@#T There are many people born in to the wrong body. I have a friend that adopted a little boy. The child has gender issues, he believes he is in the wrong body. My friend being a loving and caring parent decided to talk to his son openly. His son is 10 years old and can express himself well. They decided that they would seek a therapist that was trained in this area. After a lot of therapy, everyone agreed be knew what he was talking about, knew what he wanted. He is transitioning in to a girl, not overnight but gradually. The child is happy and becoming who he really should be. As I read this article, the person who wrote it did not explain that this is not an overnight process it takes many years and a lot of professional help before these decisions are made. We should not judge people because they are different, or believe that because they are gay mothers that they wanted a female daughter.they probably knew well in advance that this young child had a gender issue. Kudos to those mothers that have the heart and love to help this child grow to who he feels he should be. Heather, HE is not a little girl, and never will be a girl or a woman just a horribly mutilated male. I wish people would get over this fairy tale commonly known as a sex change operation there is no such thing! When the operation to change a male into a female is complete, you dont have a female. What you have is a horribly disfigured male pretending to be a female! If you take DNA from that person and clone it, you will NOT get a female, you will get another male! So-called gender reassignment surgery is one of the most unethical, immoral things the medical profession has ever come up with! The procedure should be outlawed and any doctor who performs it should be put in jail! Sickening, but they probably love it in CA. Come on Heather!!! It is apparent that the child is still a child not fully capable of making life altering decisions. Your use of the word transphobic is akin to the word homophobic. The homosexuals, their supporters, are too quick to throw those words around. They arent even the right terms to use. Homophobia implies a fear of homosexuals or the act of homosexuality. That is FAR from the truth. The vast majority of people dont fear it, we simply find it disgusting. The proper term should be homodisgustia. Google it. It is a true story but I dont believe its fair to say they coerced him into it. Regardless how the decision was made, I dont believe an eleven year old should be able to make those kinds of decisions for themselves. When he has grown up then he can address it. I dont believe the parents forces their child into this and I do believe they have good intentions at heart, but I also believe that it was a foolish decision to give into their childs pleas and do this at such a young age. Kids dont know what they need and thats why parents should help them make wise decisions until they are old enough to choose for themselves. Regardless if he wants to or not, he is not old enough to make that kind of decision. If a doctor tells a woman she has to be at least 25 yrs old with at least 2 children before he will perform a tubaligation, then this little 11 yr old is not old enough to began any procedure to change his sex! He is a child, that means in 1 yr or 2 he could change his mind! If he is an adult, it is his decision, and he can handle living with it. I dont understand peoples way of thinking these days! Why dont you actually post some facts, or words from the little girls OWN mouth? Here: http://www.cnn.com/2011/09/27/health/transgender-kids/ Not surprisingly, the article you posted is just transphobic hate. There is plenty to go around. It is not uncommon at all for trans kids to know who they are at a very young age. Usually parents just ignore or deflect or try to force them into their preassigned gender. Trans kids who get proper treatment get hormone blockers to delay puberty. Hormone blockers dont do anything that is not reversible. Surgery isnt usually done until they are 18 (since it is irreversible). This is some bullsh*t! This is an outrage! WTF!!! 2 issues: 2) Is there a scenario where you would not condemn this action? What if the boy was the child of a normal family? Im not saying what they are doing is right, but dammit people, isnt there enough going on in your lives without trying to live somebody elses? Can I just ask how much of this is true? Do we have actual video proof of the kids feelings on the subject? Or is the author of this article projecting their own beliefs on what should be happening in this situation? The internet doesnt need more hate. Everyone has the potential to be lovely to each other, even when they disagree. wtf love yourself or nobody will .. Then why the f@#k didnt they adopt a girl in the first place. Both of them ought to be arrested, or give them the change operation ",3
2,"Latest Email Cache Messes With Hillarys Fallen And Cant Get Up Timeline It does seem like beating a dead horse to writers who are constantly publishing on the same stuff, but this Hillary Clinton email thing is leading to one concern or scandal after another. This time, an email surfaced in a cache that disrupts the timeline as laid out by Drudge. Wellas it happens, in the midst of all the falls, and before the brain injury incident of 2012, it seems that the former Secretary of State was passing emails back and forth on a drug called Provigil. The active ingredient is called modafinil and it is used to combat sleepiness for a number of sleep related disorders. According to the wikipedia page for the generic, physicians are known to prescribe the drug to help with other ailments. Modafinil is also used off-label to treat sedation and fatigue in many conditions, including depression,[15][16] fibromyalgia, chronic fatigue syndrome, myotonic dystrophy,[17] opioid-induced sleepiness,[18] spastic cerebral palsy,[19] and Parkinsons disease.[20]Modafinil has been shown to improve excessive daytime somnolence and fatigue in primary biliary cirrhosis.[21] Normally, what drugs people are taking or researching really is not a matter of public need to know, but we are talking about someone running for president of the United States. What makes this especially interesting to we non-medical people following the Hillary Clinton health non-saga is that in August of 2011, not only was Hillary researching a drug that is used to treat Parkinsons Disease one of the many possibilities of whatever is wrong with her she also was reading emails regarding something called decision fatigue. Essentially, decision fatigue is all about wearing down the synapses after having been forced to make tough decisions and trade offs all day. (This article explains it more than the wikipedia page.) Essentially, it is a part of being human, but in light of a number of other topics revealed in Hillary Clintons emails that have nothing to do with yoga or wedding plans (has anyone actually found any emails on those two issues?) the idea that her brain was fatigued while she was Secretary of State is alarming.

2,"Dr Convinced Clinton May Still Have Blood Clot From 2012 Concussion Back in 2014 Conan OBrien aired a clever little spoof of Hillary Clintons 2012 concussion, one that is very relevant today. Her health has only continued to deteriorate, now to the point that shes not able to deny there is a problem with more evidence manifesting herself with every public appearance. What was a joke back then is still funny today, although there is a serious side to all of this. Its not so much what happens to her that is important to the American people, many feel shes earned every bit of karma that is now paying her an untimely visit and then some. What is concerning for many Americans is that this wretched individual could actually end up, as corrupt as she clearly is, as the president of the United States. Aside from all of the legitimate reasons from a character, moral perspective, there is a physical reason why this is dangerous. As is explained in an article by John R. Coppedge, MD for The Hill: Clintons eyes did not always move in the same direction at the same time. It appears that she has a problem with her left sixth cranial nerve. That nerve serves only one function and that is to make the lateral rectus muscle contract. That muscle turns the eye in the direction away from the midline. It comes out of the base of the brain and runs along the floor of the skull, immediately beneath the brain before coursing upward to the eye. Dysfunction of that muscle causes the striking picture of the eyes not aiming in the same direction and causes the patient to suffer double vision. Like all things medical, there is a long list of potential causes but in my opinion the most likely one, based on Clintons known medical history is an intermittent lateral rectus palsy caused by damage to or pressure on her sixth cranial nerve. It is known that she suffered a traumatic brain injury in late 2012 when she fell and struck her head. What is also known is that she was diagnosed with a transverse sinus thrombosis blood clot in the major vein at the base of the brain. Almost all patients with a transverse sinus thrombosis suffer swelling of the brain and increased intracranial pressure. Most have headaches, balance issues and visual disturbances all of which Clinton was reported to have following that event. Clintons physician reported that she was placed on Coumadin (a blood thinner) to dissolve the blood clot. Actually, that is incorrect, because Coumadin has no effect on an existing clot. It serves only to decrease the chance of further clotting occurring Clintons physician has also reported that on follow up exam, the clot had resolved. That is surprising since the majority of such clots do not dissolve. The way it was documented that the clot had resolved has not been reported. If, as is statistically likely, Clintons transverse sinus is still blocked, she would still have increased pressure and swelling and decreased blood flow to her brain. That swelling would place pressure on the exposed portion of the sixth cranial nerve at the base of her brain, explaining the apparent lateral rectus palsy. And such a deficit can be partial and/or intermittent. Additionally, when patients who have decreased intracranial blood flow becoming volume depleted (dehydrated) or have a drop in blood pressure loss of consciousness can occur. That could explain her witnessed collapse in New York City on 9/11. The doctor indicates the it is more likely than not that the original clot is still in existence in its original position and still creating difficulties for Mrs. Clinton. Clearly that is something that should be evaluated, as he recommends. Her contentions that its fine, theres no need for her to be examined mean nothing and if anything only serve to illustrate her dishonesty and lack of respect for the American people. We have a right to know she has an obligation to provide the information.

2,"NYC Rally Protesting Iran Deal: Over 10,000 People Came, Allen West Exploded [Watch Here] Unbeknownst to the rest of America if you didnt know where to look, thank you mainstream media for your dereliction of duty, everyday opponents of the Iran deal, the one thats been compared to Neville Chamberlain surrendering to Adolph Hitler before World War II started, gathered on the streets and sidewalks of Times Square in New York City Wednesday evening to protest a deal the majority of Americans think is worse than a pig in a poke. According to estimates, over 10,000 people came, including former New York Governor George Pataki. Reject this deal. Protect America. Protect Israel and protect the world from freedom, Pataki said. The rally was organized by The Stop Iran Rally Coalition, a group committed to shaming Congresscritters into voting against the Iran deal negotiated by the Obama Administration that put Iran back on footing as a non-pariah nation, and unfroze billions of dollars in assets the rogue nation can now use to purchase conventional weapons of war AND pursue a nuclear program whether the agreement says they can or not. (Seriously, who trusts these people?) One of the thousands in attendance and speaking was Col. Allen West. He took the pulse of the people on the street for Fox News and the pulse came down to a single issue: trust. The people on the street recognized that Iran cannot be trusted. We cannot trust Iran. So why would we think for one minute that they are going to honor any type of agreement? This is what he had to say at the rally: From the photographs posted to a piece on The Jerusalem Post, those participating in the rally were of all walks of American life. The people largely are of an age to remember the 1979 hostage crisis, but exhibit all manners of dress, Christians, Jewsthis issue is unifying opposition. The organizers claim to be bi-partisan, and there is no theme among the signage other than stopping Iran. Steve Doocey of Fox News said on the video at the link above, that 77% of the American public want equal to or stronger sanctions AGAINST Iran, not the lifting that is a de facto fait accompli with the United Nations Security Council voting in favor earlier this week (as if the UN has any real power. Jeez.). With those kind of numbers, why are members of Congress even hesitating to vote against it? ",4
2,"Pediatricians Say Head Lice Not A Reason To Stay Home From School Bucking decades of directives from not just the American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP), but creeped out moms and school nurses everywhere, the AAP has updated their recommendation for lice management. The final conclusion in a list of anathemas is No healthy child should be excluded from or allowed to miss school time because of head lice. No nit policies for return to school should be discouraged. The reasons published in the clinical report for not insisting on student removal and waiting until all nits have been picked include head lice not transmitting disease (even if its really creepy and causes kids to constantly scratch their heads in class), better agents and chemicals to treat the condition and kill the bugs (the product mentioned in the report is Nix which has been available for decades), and that there is no real way to prevent the spread of head lice when kids are in school putting their heads together constantly. (Back in the 70s and 80s the rumor was theyd hide in the pile linings of coats and jump in the cloak room.) What the report does make clear is that kids with head lice do need to be treated to get rid of them. That includes washing hair with the special shampoo (Nix or Rid), and removing the lice eggs, or nits with a very fine comb. Its not like they jump from student to student when theyre sitting at their desks, [Pediatrician Wendy Proskin]said. You should encourage your kids not to share their hats and combs and hair stuff, but its not like theyre rubbing their heads up against their classmates (heads), as a general rule. As important as that is, the combing out the nit-picking is really huge, said Proskin, who also sometimes recommends the Nuvo method, a treatment developed by a dermatologist that relies only on Cetaphil, a skin cleanser. The product is combed through the hair and then blow-dried and left on for eight hours. One thing to remember about head lice: they are quite democratic. They will infest any head of hair they find. This writer was the only sibling in the house who never was infested and we used to be competitive swimmers (youd think the chlorine and algaecides would do the trick). More than one afternoon was spent holding hair while the nits were picked. But, no disease was transmitted and, yes, people missed school. The AAP now says there is no reason for this. I believe I read that they could jump up to 15 feet. It is a dirge to have kids with them each year in school, and yes in a lot of areas it was required to treat the head and return with a receipt that the products were bought. They spread somehow, so I dont think that they just imagine themselves in a kids head. My Mom was an Elementary teacher for 17 years as such we all became very well versed on this subject. Lice can jump up to 3 feet! Any child with them SHOULD stay home, according to the shampoos directions, otherwise, what will happen is an entire classroom infestation then any siblings will spread it to their classrooms as well! This article is completely nonsensical, unless the author is willing to sit in a classroom to see how long it takes for them to contract the condition in a classroom with a lice ridden child! Ever seen anyone with head lice??cant get far enough away from them fast enough.what a lousy topicpun intended!!! ",1

2,"Latest Soros Leak: How To Censor The Internet As if the thought of handing over control of the internet to the United Nations wasnt scary enough (its really handing over the naming rights of the ISP addresses), the latest email/communication to catch the eye of the Daily Caller News Foundation from the DCLeaks cache of 2,500, deals with the topic of controlling information available on the internet. Specifically, what is to be taken down and what will be allowed to remain. The document itself is dated in 2014 and outlines the Open Society Soros and his non-profits seek to promotewith private opinion censorship. Our freedom of expression work furthers the free exchange of information and ideas via the media and internet, andproposes to begin to address the free expression and association rights of NGOs. The internet has been a key toolfor promoting freedom of expression and open societies as in the Arab Spring and is a potential safeguardagainst monopoly control of information in such places as China and Central Asia, page 19 of the document notes. But it is also presenting underaddressedchallenges, including lack of regulation of private operators that are able to decide, without due processprocedures, what information is taken off the Internet and what may remain. A race to the bottom results from theagendas of undemocratic governments that seek to impose their hostility to free speech on the general onlineenvironment.We seek to ensure that, from among the norms emerging in different parts of the world, those mostsupportive of open society gain sway. One of the Program concepts and initiatives listed in the document is toPromote by advocating for the adoption of nuanced legal norms, and litigation an appropriatebalance between privacy and free expression/transparency values in areas of particular interest to OSFand the Justice Initiative, including online public interest speech, access to ethnic data, public healthstatistics, corporate beneficial ownership, asset declarations of public officials, and rights of NGOs tokeep information private. Another initiative is to Establish states responsibility to collect data necessary to reveal patterns of inequality, and definemodes of collection that are effective and protect privacy. (RELATED: UN Internet Agenda Tied To George Soros) Throughout the document, OSJIs position appears to bethat private actors on the internet must be brought under international control in order to prevent them from suppressing each othersfreedom of expression and speech. (Emphasis from this writer.) How that manifests is anyones guess. What is ironic with this particular document 34 pages of an outline for international control of the internet that would ensurefreedom of speech from world governments? is that it is part of a cache that has disappeared from the internet. It was wiped from the DCLeaks webpage. These are communications from the Open Society Foundation and its subsidiaries that are notoriously secretive. Astute readers will note that NGOs or non-government organizations (like the UN, Open Society Foundation, and others) should be allowed to keep their operations private, according to the document. (This would be the end of Charity Navigator and like websites that keep non-profit claim transparent and honest.) Fortunately for the rest of us, The Daily Caller saved a copy of the communications and is able to deliver a steady drip of information that will never be reported on the regular news organs. The optics are not good for anyone who thinks that American-style freedom of speech would be maintained in any sort of international takeover of the internet. This document very clearly presents the case for stamping out messaging that does not fall in line with the Open Society agenda. ",3
2,"DOH! ALERT King Of Sweden: Ban Baths To Save Energy You know the enviroweenies have gone off their rockers when someone like the King of Sweden advocates for banning baths: Are we sure this was in jest? After all, the man was simply used to a shower rather than sitting in a tub. There is a matter of optics, and perception, and then there is the matter of reality. Hot water is heated the same using the same amount of electricity or natural gas no matter which washing venue is used. Low flow shower heads, which we assume the king would be using, put out 2.5 gallons of water per minute. So, for a five minute shower (brief, by many standards), the bather would use 12.5 gallons. In the United States, a typical bathtub holds about 24 gallons of water. Given displacement when a body is submerged in the water, not many people are prone to filling up the tub beyond about halfway. So, really, which method of bathing uses more water and therefore energy? Dont answer that. The question remains, was this question from an avowed environmentalist really asked in jest, or was he planting the seeds for one of the movements most ardent desires: to see humanity bathing less often in order to keep clean water from running out. (Note there was no mention of hot tubs or jacuzzis which keep the water recycling, but use an unbelievable amount of power to run the jets and keep the water hot.) But stillGood King Carl XVIs thinking out loud is rather intriguing since the push for not bathing in western Europe just after the Renaissance was supposedly one of the contributing factors in the last major plague. A whole lot of people died in that one. (The Church, actually, is somewhat at fault for this as bathing had been done in public bath houses prior to that time. Something about no shame in public nudity. When the plague hit in the 16th century there was a push to close the bath houses, which may well have made things worse. One of many steps that the Church took that ended in disaster. The path to hell is paved with good intentions and all that.) So, did the King of Sweden really mean for us to quit taking baths? Since he didnt mention showering, it doesnt matter exactly. There will still be a way to batheeven if we have to be quick about it. Dont know about any of the readers out there, but the clean, city water being piped into this house comes right out of the Mississippi River below the confluence with the Missouri. Its filtered for DAYS in one of the great civil engineering marvels of our time, the Chain of Rocks water treatment plant. Dont think well be running out of clean water any time soon. ",3
2,"German Government: We Cant Find All The Migrants Over in Germany, the government is suddenly faced with quite a quandary. They cant find about half of the 1.1 million migrants processed in their EASY system (Erstverteilung von Asylbegehrenden, which translates to Initial Allocation System for Asylum Seekers) which was designed to provide basic necessities ahead of actual asylum registration. 600,000 of those registered in the initial wave have vanished. Government statistics show that Germany registered 1.1million applications by the end of last year under its EASY system, which does not record much more than an applicants county of origin. About half of those people cannot be located. Theyve vanished. Disappeared. Gone poof. Pulled a Frodo with the ring. According to the Daily Mail, there are a number of possibilities of why this is the case: Whatever is the case, Germany, famous for keeping accurate records during the Holocaust and Olympic swimming doping days, has 600,000 applications for entry to the country for people who may not exist. It has been found that half the migrants did, in fact, register more than once in order to be sent to a different location than the one they originally drew. Aside from the obvious alarms that the nation does not know who they took in given the number of people who applied more than once, and then lied about their country of origin for better luck in being accepted, etc., the records needed to be sure that German cities meet their quota of hosted asylum seekers are now amazingly inaccurate. In addition, the state and local governments at the other end are not seeing the number of actual applications for asylum they were expecting. The way the system was supposed to work was that the refugee got into the country on the EASY train, and then was to report to officials in their destination city where the officials were to take care of the details. So far,only 476,649 326,529 men and 50,120 women have completed the asylum registration process leaving 600,000 unaccounted for. With the New Years eve sex attacks, the rape game reported by authorities, and much more bad news coming from the country that wanted to be so generous, this is more bad and cautionary news for a general population already not happy with leadership in Germany and other countries for letting in the migrants in the first place.

2,"Ashley Madison Data Dump Includes Lots Of Government Emails Well, alrighty then. When Ashley Madison, the Lift is short. Have an affair tool to find other cheating minded people got hacked earlier this year, we all heard that the amount of information stolen from it was pretty substantial. Well, according to an executives at more than one internet security company, we now know that the hack itself was HUGE thanks to a data dump by Impact Team the people claiming responsibility for the hack. From The Hill: To add insult to injury in this case, the people responsible, made all the data stolen publicly available in a data dump. At this time, according to Digital Trends, the information is only available via a Tor browser on the dark web, but sooner or later all of it will make its way to the mainstream. Wired claims that the information goes back eight years and includes transactions which opens a lot of people to the risk of credit card fraud. At this point, several site users have identified their own information within the data dump that has been published in order to shame the people on it, according to Impact Team. Find yourself in here? they said in a statement posted with the data dump. It was [Avid Life Media] that failed you and lied to you. Prosecute them and claim damages. Then move on with your life. Learn your lesson and make amends. Embarrassing now, but youll get over it. That would be lovely except for the 15,000 government related email addresses found in the dump. Apparently, many of them were from a domain that isnt actually used by government workers, whitehouse.gov, but still there were many from servers connected to both houses of Congress, the State Department (shocked? me neither) and the Department of Homeland Security. There were also several from military address. Even the Brits found some emails related to their government servers. The Digital Trends piece includes more information from the Impact Team statement that may give insight to motivation for the hack and the data dump: The group said it was prompted to hack the site because it was angered by the fraud, deceit and stupidity of ALM and their members. It criticized the apparent dishonesty of AshleyMadisons full delete feature that promises to entirely remove all data linked to a profile for a fee of $19. Impact Team called this a complete lie, claiming former members information was retained by the sites operator. Ashley Madison denied Impact Teams claim. Too bad for those men, theyre cheating dirtbags and deserve no such discretion, Impact Team wrote in July. Too bad for ALM, you promised secrecy but didnt deliver. In a statement accompanying Tuesdays data dump, the hackers said ALM had failed to take down Ashley Madison and Established Men, so now everyone gets to see their data. It added, Keep in mind the site is a scam with thousands of fake female profiles. See ashley madison fake profile lawsuit; 90-95% of actual users are male. Chances are your man signed up on the worlds biggest affair site, but never had one. He just tried to. If that distinction matters. Looks like someone either got caught or scorned and went for revenge, and ruined a lot of lives in the process possibly even thousands of government workers. (Washington, D.C. has more Ashley Madison members than any other city.) All this goes to prove is be careful where you go and what you do on the internet. It can always come back to haunt. ",3
2,"Anonymous - When Only The Left Is Left Nothing Will Be Right The clock is already running on the latest dictatorial raping and pillaging of America by the dictator squatting in our White House, Hussein Obama. We have less than thirty days before the anti-American criminal steals yet more of our assets and simply turns it over to the global government at the United Nations, seriously impacting our First Amendment rights to free speech. For unknown reasons they treat the theft as if it is mere stupidity on the part of the illegal occupier of our White House. If only it were ignorance or stupidity wed have a chance to educate a hapless idiot. Subversive hatred is a lot harder to correct, dare we say impossible. The Anonymous spokesman states, president Barack Obama is determined to give away control of the Internet within one month, one of the worst blunders in the history of national security, economic policy and the fight for national security generally. They provide some background on the supposed justification for this turnover, supposedly because Obama was caught spying on world leaders and felt drastic measure were warranted to shore up relationships and assure our allies. One such injured ally happens to be his close partner in the globalization by Islamification of the world, Angela Merkel. Shes likely already recovered from the incident, but its really just an excuse anyway. He point out that the Secretary of Commerce, Penny Pritzker is a billionaire political appointment without a tech resume to match. She was likely given the position as a tool with the anticipation of this steal as well as the TPP, an assault on our economy and sovereignty that Obama still threatens to force through in the lame duck session of the terminally lame Congress. The Anonymous spokesman points out that the regime has ignored critics of the plan. They point out that transferring control of domain names to a body like the UNs international telecommunications union, ITU, could leave autocratic nations like Russia, China and even Iran in charge of the worlds most important free medium. US control of domain names, he points out, has guaranteed freedom of speech and commerce across the internet against the strenuous efforts of countries like China and Iran to suppress Internet traffic and content. In addition, victims of international terror have found potential relief in US courts by suing to seize the domain names of countries like Iran in lieu of direct compensation. Without US control those victims would have no possible recourse. He notes legislation passed to defund the transfer and to give Congress a thirty day notice of any such intent, once again the law is just a minor irritation to the dictator of America, who does as he damn well pleases. He reminds us that Obama and Clinton have given the worlds dictators nuclear weapons, our uranium, our money and our sovereignty. Why wouldnt he give our Internet away to his fellow dictators as well? He points out that the next and real president, if it is Donald Trump, may be able to correct these injustices but it will require jailing the traitors at DOJ, State Department, UN and DoD. He urges, Lets select a real American my friends before there is no America left. ",3
2,"Mysterious Purple Orb Found On Ocean Floor [VIDEO] It looks like something from a science fiction movie, experts say it is a blobby, bright purple, mass that lives under the water. A lot of water. But what it is, is anyones guess. As for the scientists that discovered it, even they arent exactly sure just yet. This strange orb was found near the Channel Islands by the research vesselNautilus. The ship is a floating laboratory equipped with cameras that can peer deep down to the ocean floor. Researchers with theOcean Exploration Trustposted a video on Monday showing the unusual object. Researchers said the Nautilus spied a small bright-purple orb underwater in the Channel Islands off the coast of California, but even they are not sure what it is. The main focus for the vehicles Channel Islands mission is to study deep-sea corals, but the odd sphere attracted the scientists attention. The video includes a soundtrack of the researchers making real-time observations as the camera sweeps along. They call it a purple blob and then wonder aloud What is that? The researchers throw out some scientific names as possibilities before deciding to suck it up into a tube for a closer look. They wonder if it might be an egg sac or an embryo of some sort. Theres a moment when the new discovery is almost lost to them. A lone crab closes in on the orb and jars it with its leg, but the researchers of the Nautilus successfully grab the sphere using a remote-controlled suction tube. TheNautilus website offers an update on the oddball discovery: This unidentified purple orb stumped our scientists onboard. After sampling, it began to unfold to reveal two distinct lobes. This could possibly be a new species of nudibranch. A Nudibranch is a type of marine mollusks. They have soft bodies and some of them are quite colorful, appearing in bright shades of orange, blue and pink. Some have slug-like shapes, while others have small branch-like protuberances. CLICK HERE FOR VIDEO OF THIS AMAZING CREATURE. If youre looking for answers as to exactly what the purple orb is, youll probably have to wait for some time. The Nautilus team notes, It could take several years for scientists to determine if this organism is a new species. It seems that just when we think we know all there is to know, something always jumps up and kicks us in the seat of the pants proving that we are not near as smart as we think we are. Three quarters of the surface of the earth is covered in water, of that area, we have really explored less than 2%. There could literally be hundreds of thousands of species that we have never seen or will see just a few thousand feet down. Nautiluslive.org contributed to this story. 2016 R. L. Grimes ",1
2,"Time Capsule Items Revealed Yet Questions Remain The contents from last weeks news story (click to view) have finally been revealed. Inside the capsule, about the size of a shoebox, were letters, photographs, newspaper clippings, and political campaign buttons, exactly what historians expected to find. They didnt remove the items at first, afraid the pieces would fall apart upon being touched. Their fears were unwarranted, however, as the items were in pristine condition. You open up the box, and its like they put the stuff in there yesterday. Everything looks like it was just written yesterday, said Elizabeth Leet, spokeswoman for the Bostonian Society. Included in the time capsule were two nails, one from the Old State House and one from a historic building called Old South Church, and a piece of wood with a message attached: Wood removed from the Old Lion age of some 21 years in 1900. Also included was a bill of tuition, a piece of music from 1901 signed by John Silver, and a die cut printing of the Boston Herald building. Everything listed in the letter found by Samuel Rogers great-great-granddaughter and referenced in the old Boston Globe article was included in the time capsule. The writer of the 1901 Boston Globe article added that the items contained will prove interesting when the box is opened many years hence. Of course, neither the letter nor the article mentioned anything about the mysterious red book that was found inside. The hardcover book had no visible title. When historians opened the cover, they found it to be a presidential message from Grover Cleveland titled Foreign Relations of the United States. The subtitle read The Annual Message of the President of the United States, citing that it was transmitted to Congress on December 7, 1896. Why would this be included in the time capsule but not mentioned in the lists? ",1
2,"DHS Admits Refugees In 18% Of ISIS Terror Plots, Convicted Of Terrorism In Senate Hearings on Thursday, Director of U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services, Leon Rodriguez spoke proudly of his agencys record. He said, The fact is that since September 11th, not a single act of actual terrorist violence has been committed by a refugee who has undergone our screening procedures. There have been individuals who came to the US as children, there are individuals who came a long time ago, before our modern procedures. He continues, But since September 11th, all we have had is conspiracies, not only by refugees but in fact by US born persons, other kinds of immigrants. Its really an equal opportunity world. Senator Sessions interrupts, asking, You dont count conspiracies? Rodriguez states in response that since the attempt was interrupted prior to violence taking place, they dont consider it in their glowing self-evaluations. Its worth mentioning that these people tend to follow the lead of DHS Secretary Jihadi Jeh Johnson and create deception through word-parsing. It is noteworthy that he does not state who is given these screening procedures. They might easily administer one program they call screening, which is given to Italian nuns or their equivalent and another that is labeled vetting, preliminary questionnaire or anything other than screening and then be able to recite those numbers without providing false testimony to Congress. It would be misleading, but every one of them is deceptive; Congress does nothing even when they catch them in a lie. Rodriguez says that since they began admitting Syrian refugees under the current crisis, seven percent have been denied because of either credibility or security issues identified based upon information from law enforcement intelligence databases and about twice as many placed on hold. Combining those two numbers offers a roughly 80% approval rate. For a terrorist nation in which there are virtually no Christians included among those imported, thats an awfully high rate to be declared terrorist free. Senator David Vitter cites a study by Fordham University which established that 18% of all of those involved in ISIS prosecutions were either refugees or asylees. Vitter goes on to dismantle and expose the disingenuous and deceptive nature of Rodriguezs statement regarding their success. He does so while also noting the careful crafting of statements to create a false impression.

2,"Something To Hide? - Saudis Threaten Asset Dump If Congress Releases 28 Redacted 9/11 The leaks about the content within the 28 redacted pages of the 9/11 commission report, or the simple fact that the censored section exists at all notwithstanding, theres a whole new reason to be suspiciousofwhat is hidden within. The uproar over talk of itbeing released, the threats being issued by Saudi officials and the concern over financial repercussions levied bythe Saudis that would be quite damaging in their nature indicate that there is some fire underneath the thick smoke. According to CNN, Saudi Arabia is warning that it will sell off hundreds of billions in American assets if they are exposed, supposedly in the name of protecting themselves from financial jeopardy. Such assets would potentially become a target for attachment if the information were available as evidence upon which to build a lawsuit. That may be partially true, but it is the hit the value of such assets would take that is prompting some servants of the establishment elite to have second thoughts, or to at least provide that appearance publicly. A senior Obama official, when asked if there would be a veto of legislation if it were passed by Congress, replied, rather than entertain a hypothetical, we believe there needs to be more careful consideration of the potential unintended consequences of its enactment before proceeding with legislation. Theyre willing to weigh national and probably their own personal financial and political interests in perpetuating the cover-up versus the sure loser of doing the right thing and exposing Saudi and other wrongdoing. There area whole host of questions surrounding the fairy tale that was presented as the official determination of what happened in September of 2001. A correction of the record has to start somewhere, the 28 missing pages seems like a great place to start. The Saudis actually sought the release of the 28 pages of the report, or at least presented that position publicly, back in 2003. At that time it was their friends the Bush family that objected, citing a weak and disputed claim of its release having a negative impact on the nations ability to gather intelligence. Its quite possible that George W. Bush allowed his allies in the Saudi royal family, whom he was fond of holding hands with as they strolledabout his Crawford ranch,to pretend to be in favor of the release as a means of denial, assured that Bush had their back andwould use a false national security tack to block any release. Hussein Obama and John Kerry have both been very cozy with the Iranians lately. Is this still more accommodation to them, an overt move to vilify the Saudis, which would be welcomed as the ultimate PR strike against their bitter enemy? Is it an opportunity for Hussein Obama to play the Saudis and Iranians, and then provide the Saudis with the continuation of the protection they already had and have it interpreted as a gesture of assistance and support? Are we actually willing to creditthat level of cunning to the pink line Obama regime? The bill is sponsored by the number two leadership for both the Senate Republicans and Democrats, John Cornyn (R-TX) and Chuck Schumer (D-NY).The Saudis chose not to respond to a CNN request for comment.

2,"WHOOPS: Paris Terror Attacks Ringleader Faked Refugee Status Lets just stop with the migrant and refugee talk and be real for a minute. The Syrian people pushing and shoving their way into Europe are invaders and the man who supposedly put the Paris terrorist attacks of November 13 in motion is one of them. According to the French Prime Minister, Manuel Valls,Abdelhamid Abaaoud the reported mastermind or ringleader of the Paris terrorist attacks claimed by ISIS slipped into Europe from Syria in the mass confusion during the migrant crisis that saw hundreds of thousands of Middle Easterners and Northern Africans overwhelming the borders of the countries that make up the European Union. Abaaoud had claimed he successfully moved back and forth from Europe to Syria coordinating terror attacks, and narrowly escaped a January police raid in the Belgian city of Verviers. Allah blinded their vision and I was able to leave despite being chased after by so many intelligence agencies, he told the ISIS magazine Dabiq. What is most terrifying about this as described in the Fox News quote above is that Abaaoud was a known entity to intelligence officials OF MULTIPLE NATIONS. He is described as a tactical guy by counter terrorism people, and much like Mohammad Atta, an organizer of people on the ground. Valls said some of the Paris attackers had taken advantage of the massive influx of migrants into Europe fleeing war in the Middle East. These individuals took advantage of the refugee crisis of the chaos, perhaps, for some of them to slip in to France, he told French TV. Others were in Belgium already. And others, I must remind you, were in France. And so it seems that only condom manufacturers are paying attention to Greek mythology. This guy who was killed by Paris police on Wednesday, was not only known to the people who track ISIS, but they thought he was still in Syria. Which, of course, begs the question, how many more of these terrorists are in Europe thanks to the welcoming open borders the leftist leaders over there are so proud of. Valls also warned that the passport-free Schengen zone is a risk of Europe fails to take responsibility over border controls, according to Sky News. European Union ministers are expected to meet in Brussels where they are expected to tighten border security in each of the 26-member nations. Great, but its probably too late. Time to get out the classics of Greek and Roman Mythology and Aesops Fables and relearn the lessons before the left completely COEXISTS us into our deaths. ",3
2,"Homeland Security - Intentionally Wiping Our Southern Border From The Map Too much consolidated power is a dangerous thing and that was one fear many people had regarding the creation of the Department of Homeland Security. Now, under the Obama regime, those fears are becoming increasingly more substantiated. With an imperial president come imperial agencies. The situation on Americas border with the bandito nation to the south is clearly of deliberate construction. The Department of Homeland Security is working as the lead agency in the conduct of a program to achieve a political goal. That is not the way Americas government is supposed to function, but much that is taking place on a regular basis these days is counter to American norms. This type of abuse would not have been possible before the Department of Homeland Security was created. There was too much independence for a rogue controlling authority to act improperly. That was changed when, under a guise of unified intelligence sharing and a more streamlined threat response, the consolidation of previously separate entities took place. Even pre-dating the current regime, George W. Bush initiated a war on the Border Patrol which was illustrated when he inexplicably had his hand-picked El Paso U.S. Attorney, JohnnySutton, target two agents who were simply doing their jobs. The distorted justification was a shooting incident in which a drug smuggler was shot in the buttocks. Those two men, Ignacio Ramos and Jose Compean served two years in solitary confinement for protecting America. The attack on those defending our nation has continued on a downhill track since then. Now under this current regime, our agents are instructed to run away from rock-throwing illegals and vehicles, and have very restrictive rules ofengagement. Its as though they are meant to be seen, but nothing more. The illusion of defense and protection is there for the American people, but the reality of open borders exists for those who traffic in drugs and people. As for the human invasion, we remember that George W. Bush, along with Mexican President Vicente Fox and Canadian Prime Minister Paul Martin, signed an agreement creating the Security and Prosperity Partnership of North America (SPP) in March of 2005. It was a public acknowledgment and the move towards a North American Union. That foundation continues to be being built upontoday. It has apparently reached the stage of development in which blatant lawlessness is required. The Department of Homeland Security is a perfect mechanism for the concealment of the extent of the importation of this overwhelming mass of a dependent population from the American people. DHS has established and operate a catch, induct, and release into society program. The necessary transportation and documentation are provided by DHS. For those needing to travel by air, TSA is under Homeland Security, so waivers to the photo ID requirement are offered. Transportation is a key factor in concealing the degree to which we are being invaded through dilution. Patriotic whistle blowers are intimidated and threatened for exposure of what is going on. Those within the ranks of our Border Patrol are ordered to violate their principles and rather than prevent the invasion, forced to facilitate it to the point of being nursemaids and changing diapers. This not only achieves the administration goal of facilitating a huge invading force, but also demoralizes those who would be the most vocal critics of the treason that they are witnessing. They will eventually quit or learn to look the other way. The regime is presently engaged in the creation of an industry of dependent support agencies, churches and community groups as well as individuals who are being paid very well for their role as caregivers in the scheme to meld the Americas. There are plenty of sellouts ready to trade the well-being of their nation for personal gain. Religious groups attempt to absolve themselves of complicity. Citing humanitarian concerns and being above politics, they are in reality some of the chief offenders and enablers of this treason. What could be most dangerous about this reality is that, as bad as Hussein Obama is, this scheme didnt originate with him and Homeland Security Secretary Johnson. They are playing an important part, but the initial components were placed and the wheels set in motion long before they arrived on the scene. There is an orchestrated event taking place, much bigger than simply what is happening on our border. It is about the destruction of our country. ",3
2,"2015 COP21 UN Climate Change Document Draft: SHOW ME THE MONEY Yes, we were all expecting it, but maybe not spelled out in so spectacular a fashion. The draft document of the 2015 United Nations Conference on Climate Change of Paris fame outright calls for the direct transfer of cash from developed nations to not so developed nations to the tune of $100 Billion ANNUALLY by 2020. Resolves to enhance the provision of urgent and adequate finance, technology and capacity-building support by developed country Parties in order to enhance the level of ambition of pre-2020 action by Parties, and in this regard strongly urges developed country Parties to scale up their level of financial support, with a concrete roadmap to achieve the goal of jointly providing USD 100 billion annually by 2020 for mitigation and adaptation while significantly increasing adaptation finance from current levels and to further provide appropriate technology and capacity-building support. (Where does the UN and the Obama Administration think we are going to get this kind of cash given the amount of debt the developed countries are in, was not addressed other than to tell us to get on it.) So, this Paris UN Climate Change agreement that still faces ratification in the Senate whether Obama wants it to or not more or less says the rich countries are to finance the poor countries in their quest for renewable energy sufficiency. Without defining who is considered rich and who is not. In another world, this would be known as wealth transfer. (To people with a brain, it still is.) And then there is this: 1. Developed country Parties shall provide financial resources to assist developing country Parties with respect to both mitigation and adaptation in continuation of their existing obligations under the Convention. 2. Other Parties are encouraged to provide or continue to provide such support voluntarily. 3. As part of a global effort, developed country Parties should continue to take the lead in mobilizing climate finance from a wide variety of sources, instruments and channels, noting the significant role of public funds,through a variety of actions, including supporting country-driven strategies, and taking into account the needs and priorities of developing country Parties. Such mobilization of climate finance should represent a progression beyond previous efforts. We in the United States have homeless veterans and an indigent population that does need caring for, in addition to really needing to jump start a stagnant economy, and the Obama Administration is hell bent on signing away cash that we dont have per annum that is going to be needed to help pay off an $18 TRILLION debt, and Secretary of State John Kerry thinks this is a good deal? What would a bad deal look like? Is the UN really that suicidal so as to think the USA is a bottomless pit of cash? When we run out of money sending it all to third world hell holes, who is the UN going to bankrupt next? It is one thing when international agreements disguised as UN treaties call for help from more technologically advanced nations to lend assistance and guidance in building infrastructure and working toward better humanitarian living conditions for the people in poorer nations, but just sending cash? Americans have done that for decades and in many cases, the peoples condition in the aided countries does not improve, but tinpot dictators and various despots always seem to end up living in luxury by comparison to their subjects. How can we believe this time the situation will be any different? P.S. Even actual hard core climate scientists are calling foul at what the Paris UN Climate Change Conference is espousing. James Hansen, the godfather of the movement, says: Its a fraud really, a fake, he says, rubbing his head. Its just bullshit for them to say: Well have a 2C warming target and then try to do a little better every five years. Its just worthless words. There is no action, just promises. As long as fossil fuels appear to be the cheapest fuels out there, they will be continued to be burned. Never mind that petrochemicals are the cheapest and the most efficient form of energy out there right now. ",3
2,"The Business Deals That May Destroy Carly Fiorinas Presidential Run Its about time. The more established of the conservative blogosphere have finally started to dig deeper on Carly Fiorina. For so long, its just been Donald Trump expounding to the world about how poor her record was at Lucent and Hewlett-Packard. Now, the really awful stuff is starting to come out on the deal making H-P did with Iran while Carly was in charge. From Breitbart: during her time as the chief executive of HP, she sold hundreds of millions of dollars worth of products to Iran through a foreign subsidiary, despite strict U.S. export sanctions, Bloomberg reports. While running the show at HP, Fiorina thwarted sanctions by dealing with Iran through European and Middle Eastern companies, allowing for the tech company to dominate the market in Tehran. By 2007, HP-made printers accounted for 41 percent of the total market share in the country, the report states. Fiorinas dealings with Iran were established thanks to a 1997 agreement made between the U.S. company and the Indian-owned, Dubai-based Redington Gulf. Carlys answer to this? Didnt know it was happening at the time. Ri-i-i-ght. Fiorinas previous dealings with Iran werebrought up when she ran for the California Senate in 2010. At the time, her campaign spokeswoman denied that HP had committed any wrongdoing while she was CEO. It is illegal for American companies to do business in Iran. To her knowledge, during her tenure, HP never did business in Iran and fully complied with all U.S. sanctions and laws, the spokeswoman said, according to the report. But later in the campaign, the Republican candidate changed her tone on the matter, telling the Lady Globes magazine that technology could help Iran reengage with the world. But isnt it wonderful that Dell PCs and Apple iPhones are in Iran, because this is why we know that a woman has been condemned to be stoned to death because she is accused of adultery The knowledge that we gain about was going on there is important. It gives us a human face on a brutal regime, Fiorina said. Yes, it does, but Hewlett-Packard STILL did business in Iran when it was illegal to do so via executive order (Bill Clintons) even if it was through a subsidiary, and even if Apple and Dell were doing the same thing. And when Carly Fiorina WAS in charge of HP and trying to change the place and make it profitable, Bloomberg reports that the lobbying to get the sanctions lifted was hot and heavy. According to the Senate lobbying record, every year from 1999 to 2004, HPs in-house lobbyists pressed Capitol Hill to pursue unilateral sanctions reform legislation. Oops. Despite the needed outlet for the women and oppressed in Iran to get the word out of their plight, while Carly Fiorina was in charge of Hewlett-Packard, the company DID skirt U.S. law by doing business inside Iran using a foreign subsidiary, and DID lobby to have the business sanctions lifted while UN Ambassador John Bolton was putting together the coalition to financially cut Iran off from the rest of the world. To many people, that might not make much of a difference, but to the rest of us it says that Fiorina is willing to cut corners and break the law to make a buck and make herself look good. Now the question is will that matter to the not an establishment candidate crowd. ",4
2,"Libyans OKd For U.S. Flight Schools, Nuclear Science - Forget Benghazi and Evacuated Embassy Islamic terrorists of the world have cause to celebrate, at least those with Libyan passports. The United States, under the enlightened guidance of B. Hussein Obama has decided to lift the restriction on Libyans attending flight schools in the United States. They can also now receive training in nuclear science. The change in policy does seem a bit odd, considering that the United States was just forced to close our embassy in Tripoli and terrorists closed our diplomatic station in Benghazi for us less than two years ago. The supposed justification for lifting the ban is that it is no longer necessary or relevant, as the two countries have successfully worked to normalize their relationship. Usually open, fully functional embassies are an indicator of normal relationships. We dont have one. If things are too chaotic and their citizens too unruly for an embassy, how can flight schools or nuclear technology be a good idea? The naive leadership of the United States, if it can accurately be described as leadership, places much more emphasis on how they label a nation and empty promises than they do on a track record and substance. It is clear to even the most casual observer that Libya is a hotbed of Islamic unrest, with the now customary America-hating factions holding significant influence over large segments of their populations. America is not obligated in any way to be the Job Corps for Arab states. Let them get their training and their visas in some other nation. The presently banned careers of aviation maintenance, flight operations, or nuclear-related fields should remain banned. If anything, they were less of a risk with Gaddafi in power than they are now under anarchy. Weve got plenty of other crises to deal with already, thanks to this regime. We dont need to go exploring for more. A DHS spokesman, S.Y. Lee, told the Washington FreeBeaconthat the Obama administration is reviewing its policies towards Libya to see how they might be updated to better align with U.S. interests in light of its revolution. Again, the naivet of the community organizer is exposed. Post- revolution Libya is no bargain and that is not an effective selling point. Rep. Bob Goodlatte (R., Va.) accused DHS of stonewalling and turning a blind eye to real terrorist threats that exist in Libya today. He released a statement saying, The House Judiciary Committee has repeatedly sought information about the Administrations policy reversal but political appointees at the Department of Homeland Security have stonewalled the Committees requests and have not articulated why it is in Americans best interests to change policy. He added, Given the ongoing volatility in Libya, it is unconscionable and completely irresponsible that the Administration plans to lift a longstanding policy that protects Americans and our national security from threats in the region. Rep. Trey Gowdy (R., S.C.) also slammed the administrations decision to reverse the ban. He said, The burden of proof for advocating a change in the status quo lies with the Administration. Is post-revolutionary Libya secure enough to change the rules? Why now? He asked, What evidence does the Administration have to assert the relationship between Libya and the US has indeed normalized? Gowdy added, It is extremely concerning that DHS is moving forward with these plans, but has not provided information on the policy change despite repeated requests from Members.

2,"Real Life Antarctica Sea Ice Not Cooperating With Global Warming Hoax In yet ANOTHER case of the experts were oh, so wrong, it seems that the research stations in Antarctica are in danger of being stranded due to the presence of too much sea ice. From The Guardian: Sea ice around Antarctica is currently at record levels for May, part of a trend of increasing ice around the frozen continent making it harder to resupply and refuel research stations. Rod Wooding, from the Australian Antarctic Division, said last year ships couldnt get anywhere near the Australian research site, Mawson station, requiring a years worth of supplies and fuel to be flown in by helicopter. [That] is inadequate for the long-term sustainability of the station, Wooding said. Other national programs have had similar problems, the French in particular, the Japanese also. Whoops. It seems that the forecasters didnt see this coming, because according to all the climate models all that sea ice was supposed to be gone by now, or at the very least, thinning as a number of scientific papers posited in the last year. The current theory on why there is so much sea ice in Antarctica when CLEARLY there shouldnt be per Global Warming, is that there was a change in wind patterns or something. Wouldnt be that its been colder on this planet of late, would it? Well, according to the experts theres an explanation for that, too. Tony Worby, the chief executive of the Antarctic Climate and Ecosystems Cooperative Research Centre said,Those changes of wind are driven by the depletion of ozone in the stratosphere and the increasing greenhouse gas in the atmosphere. The El Nino phenomenon, too, drives changes in pressure which drives changes in wind which drives changes in sea ice, he said. Oh, thats right, its an El Nio year. (Wrote about that yesterday. Is 2015 FINALLY an El Nio Year? The answer is yes.) As Matt Vespa over at Townhall put it, you mean this is a natural phenomenon???? Gee, imagine that. Theres a record amount of sea ice in an El Nio year just like the other El Nio years. More greenhouse gases have been blamed on human activity, but so far, no scientist, researcher or climate change expert has been able to pin El Nio or his sister La Nia on people. There are a number of scientists gathered in Hobart in Tasmania this week to discuss better sea ice predicting because at this point, the only way to get to the research stations is via helicopter and that is just too expensive for maintaining the global warming research facilities in Antarctica long term. Plus, the Antarctic researchers want to avoid the debacle of theAkademik Shokalskiy, the research vessel caught in a sudden freeze in December 2013. Given that the other end of the earth the Arctic circle also is seeing record ice in a less than active period of hurricanes and tornadoes, maybe the lack of cooperation from Mother Nature and the sea ice in Antarctica is trying to tell the climate change movement something that would impact us more than anything else they could do: give it up.

2,"Dead People Are Labelled Inactive Voters In North Carolina As we inch towards the 2016 general elections that is assuming they happen it is incumbent on each of the 50 states to, well, purge their voter rolls of people no longer living in the state, as well as those no longer living. Despite the integrity implications, this is never much of a priority in states where a laundry list of initiatives are spending tax payer cash by handing it over to non-taxpayers, so a number of nonprofit and civic groups are reminding the states to do just that. Getting the dead off of any voter roll should be no problem, right? Just cross reference one database against another. Minor issue that True the Vote and other voter integrity projects are encountering: the states dont always have such databases and some of them, like North Carolina, are labeling dead people the same as those who have left the borders. They are called inactive. Thats pretty much an understatement. Contract out to a private company and this issue, like lack of customer service skills at the DMV, will go away. The big problem, according to the Voter Integrity Project of North Carolina in a Watchdog piece, is that the number of inactive voters is growing in that state without any sort of a purge. The Voter Integrity Project of North Carolina reports that voters classified as inactive grew from 460,065 in 2007 to 739,041 this year a 62.3 percent increase. VIP calls them missing voters who election officials can no longer locate. This is worse than dead people (on the voter rolls) because you cant find them, said Jay DeLancy, executive director of VIP. The alarming recent growth in this voter category points to a more systemic problem, he said No kidding. If such voters are inactive it would be logical that they havent voted recently, so why not remove them? Logan Churchwell, spokesman for Houston-based TTV, said having more inactive voters is not unexpected in a growing state like North Carolina. Churchwell said alarm bells should go off when states fail to remove inactive voters within the eight-year window permitted by the National Voter Registration Act. As long as inactives dont stick around too long, thats OK, Churchwell told Watchdog.org. You go to war if theyre not moved off the rolls. EIGHT YEARS???? No wonder we have a voter fraud problem in the United States. Not only is there a concerted effort to force the states to accept the votes of those who cannot prove their identity at the polls, but states are leaving inactive voters on the rolls for two election cycles? And then not checking the rolls against the obituaries and death notices without prompting? In an artfully deceptive ploy, election officials name missing voters inactive. This implies they just sat out an election or two, but these people are genuinely missing and the public has been kept in the dark, DeLancy charged. Who knows, with the levels of voter apathy, inactive voters could be bloating the final tallies at the polls with no one the wiser if the total number of votes doesnt come close to the total number of people registered in any one precinct. Add that to the voter registration pushes from ACORN, Ralph Nader, the ACLU and any number of other leftist organizations and the American people are due to be misrepresented for the foreseeable future.

2,"Sen Sessions, Dunford, Carter Agree - Lurching Middle East Strategy Not Working Senator Jeff Sessions poses his observation to the witnesses, General Joseph Dunford and Defense Secretary Ashton Carter, that the situation in the Middle East will take decades to correct. He says that he has come to the conclusion that theres just going to be a lot of violence for a long time. In an Armed Services Committee hearing on March 17th, Sessions said, There wont be one victory that makes us safe, advocating a grand strategy that extends beyond elections and administrations, which is bi-partisan in nature and much less subject to deviation based upon which party is in power. General Dunford couldnt agree more, saying no more than we can develop a budget year to year and expect to be successful can we develop a strategy year to year and make lurching changes and expect to be successful. Sessions asks if he assesses it to be a generational conflict of twenty years or more. Dunford replies, Senator, I think once you look at the underlying conditions that have led to violent extremism, I cant imagine addressing those in anything less than that period of time. When you look at the economic issues, the political issues, the social issues, the educational issues, those are all things that will take a long period of time and my assessment is that violent extremism in some form will exist until those conditions across the Middle East are addressed. Secretary Carter agrees with the caveat that what cant be tolerated in a generational way is ISIS, and he states that the regime is intent on accelerating their defeat. Its an acceleration from a stalled, standing stop in the slow lane, some would argue.

2,"UNREAL! Obama Spending $1.5 BILLION A Year On Hot Air! Yes, its true. In a period of American history where we are running deficits in the tens of trillions of dollars, the Obama Administration is spending money on the equivalent of hot air. $1.5 BILLION of your tax dollars on public relations and other propaganda. According to the office of the Government Accountability Office via the Cato Institute and The Washington Times, the breakdown goes something like this: Thats 667 additional staff members added to the 5,238 already working for the fed as of 2008. (The number is under 5,100 at this point, but five thousand PR flacks? Were they expecting an invasion of bad news?) Spending $1.5 billion on government PR activities is a huge waste of money. That sort of spending should be drastically scaled back, said Chris Edwards, a federal budget scholar at the Cato Institute. What costs so much is the median salary of $90,000. Washington is an expensive city in which to live and work, and that amount will not go far, but really, FIVE THOUSAND of these people? It seems that the Pentagon has the most with about 2,100. Veterans Affairs a cabinet department that really does need the PR help had about 286 propaganda professionals as of 2014. That number grew from 144 not quite eight years earlier. Other departments seeing their PR staffs grow included Homeland Security, Interior and Health and Human Services. What function these people serve, exactly, is not made clear. GAO investigators said in their report that agencies may have legitimate interests in communicating with the public regarding their functions, policies and activities. The report said the National Zoos webcams, the Centers for Disease Control and Preventions warnings about the Zika virus and the IRS advertising of tax credits available to taxpayers are all examples of PR activities. But Mr. Edwards, the Cato budget scholar, said the government is also paying for one-sided propaganda, including touting of federal programs that are failing. Whats needed from the federal government is not one-sided propaganda, but a more honest assessment of the costs and benefits of each program, he said. Look on the website of nearly any federal agency, and you will find glowing discussions about how programs are helping people and doing wonderful things. But there is rarely any mention of the taxpayer costs and economic damage done by these programs. What is also needed is a place for budget hawks to look for redundant and replicative services that can be consolidated or eliminated. Public relations and propaganda flacks may be a good place to look. Writers note: back in the day, the original PR people were said to need a flack jacket since they were paid to absorb bad press. Hence the name PR Flack. ",4
2,"PREPPER ALERT: Inside The National Strategic Stockpile Every now and then NPR puts out a piece that invokes a whole lot of Hollywood comparisons. This time, the reference is to Raiders of the Lost Ark (I actually think the better comparison is Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull, but the same principle applies). See, somewhere in America, we have six different GIGANTIC warehouses collectively known as the National Strategic Stockpile each of which is loaded with all sorts of stuff to get us through a biological attack. (Hopefully.) This is closer to what it looks like: According to Greg Burel, the guy in charge: If you envision, say, a Super Walmart and stick two of those side by side and take out all the drop ceiling, thats about the same kind of space that we would occupy in one of these storage locations, Burel says. A big American flag hangs from the ceiling, and shelves packed with stuff stand so tall that looking up makes me dizzy. We have the capability, if something bad happens, that we can intervene in a positive way, but then we dont ever want to have to do that. So its kind of a strange place, says Burel. But we would be foolish not to prepare for those events that we could predict might happen. Nell Greenfield Boyce, the writer of the piece, signed a confidentiality agreement, so there is no information on where any of these warehouses are, or exactly what is in them, although given the exchange from one official, its a good bet we are not stockpiling cobra antivenom. The inventory, started in 1999 with $50 million, now has an estimated value of $7 billion. The Stockpile was accessed after 9-11 and during the cleanup of Hurricane Katrina. Minute specifics of the contents of the warehouses is not available, but Greenfield Boyce writes of seeing row after row of ventilators, and includes a partial list of medications and vaccines that are contained in the buildings, although no specific amounts of each item. Addictive medicines, like painkillers, are locked up to avoid them disappearing. Medicines with time sensitive expiration dates are rotated on a regular basis. (The article was not specific about additional items like masks and durable equipment, but its a good bet that anytime these are used, they are replaced quickly.) All this preparation is both good and terrifying at the same time. Theres just one problem with the set-up as it is. The warehouse is fine in terms of the management of stuff in there. What gets in the warehouse and where does it go after the warehouse, and how fast does it go to people, is where we have questions, says Dr. Irwin Redlener, director of the National Center for Disaster Preparedness at Columbia University. Apparently, there is no distribution system in place at this time. In addition, with the continuing changes in the intelligence landscape, the realities of what we need to be stockpiling are changing. The process goes by the clunky acronym PHEMCE and involves agencies from the Department of Defense to the Food and Drug Administration. Theyre looking to acquire or develop products that can meet the threats. A lot of under-the-hood, background work goes into identifying what the size, the scope, the special needs are, and what medical countermeasures exist or need to be made, says George Korch, senior adviser to the assistant secretary for preparedness and response at the Department of Health and Human Services. That then drives the rest of the process for research, development, procurement, stockpiling, et cetera.. The government recently hired Gryphon Scientific to do an analysis of how well the stockpile was positioned to respond to a range of scenarios based on intelligence information. The studies that were done before have all been one-off. Theyve all been looking at a single type of attack at a time, or a single type of weapon of mass destruction, says [Rocco] Casagrande [of Gryphon]. They havent looked across all threats to make decisions about whether you should buy A versus B. Scared yet? Just remember that the Obama Administration is still in charge. ",3
2,"French Court Overturns Law Local Mayor Says He Will Not Comply A top French court on Friday overturned a controversial,temporary ban on Muslim-friendly burkini swimsuits. The Council of States ruling relatesspecifically to thesoutheastern town of Villeneuve-Loubet, but the decision is expected to set a legal precedent forthe approximately30seasidetownsthat have issued similar bans. Lawyer Patrice Spinosi, ofthe Human Rights League, told reporters in Paris that other mayors mustadhereto the ruling and women who have been fined for wearing burkinis can challenge the penalties. However, themayor of Sisco on the French Mediterranean island ofCorsica said he would not lift the ban following the ruling. Former President Nicolas Sarkozy, who is seeking the conservative nomination for the 2017 race, said he would bring in a nationwide burkini ban if elected to his former post. Terror analysts have warned that the dispute will fuel jihadist propaganda as groups like Isis attempt to portray France and other Western countries as at war with Muslims. According to a survey by Ifpop, 64 per cent of French people are in favor of the burkini bans, while 30 per cent described themselves as indifferent and only 6 per cent of respondents were opposed. It seems as if France is the same as the United States, they do not listen to the people either. If they did they would see that the people of France are in favor of this ban by a majority. It is always a small number of people that make up the laws for everyone else. That small number of people are usually the ones that have the worst intentions too. I have said many, many times. If the people that were in France seeking safe harbor had only good intentions they would be willing to do anything they could to make those welcoming them feel safer. But that is not the case, they want everyone else to jump and cater to them. That is not the way it should be in any country that has taken in refugees. H/T Independent UK ",4

The Washington Times is reporting: President Obama defended theIRSTuesday in an interview with Daily Show host Jon Stewart, saying the tea party-targeting scandal was actuallyCongress fault for passing a crummy law and that the real problem is the agency doesnt have enough money. Of course! Predictable big government being the Lying Leviathan they are. Its the Magic Show of Big Government: Create a Scandal, Conduct crime, and *poof* Procure more Revenue! Thats the problem! The Fed is just inefficient because of a lack of revenue! If only we had MORE cash flow! It isnt like taxpayers are helping government out much these days anyways!

2,"Obama, Do Not Even Think About Messing With The Fourth of July Alright, now Obamas done it. Him and his Environmental Protection Agency that seems to want all Americans to live in the Classical Antiquities Era whether we want to or not. [Srs. Mary Gregory and Denis forgive the gigantic grammar error.] The wackadoodles have decided to pursue draconian surface ozone levels that can only be reached by limiting some of our favorite summertime activities: grilling and setting off fireworks. From the Daily Caller: Because the proposed ozone rule is set so low, things as harmless as a few backyard chefs grilling burgers in the same area at the same time, or even festive fireworks being launched during an Independence Day celebration, could cause an area to violate federal ozone standard thresholds. Such a violation of the EPAs unreasonably low ozone limit would result in fines and other penalties for local governments from federal regulators. In an attempt to steer clear of punishment, local lawmakers will have to respond to the new EPA rules by enacting municipal grilling bans and canceling fireworks shows from sea to shining sea. Uh, yeah, no. Ixnay on the anbay. Not even. No can do, you Marxist comrades. Aint happenin. See, the municipalities out here on the fruited plain are a bit busy with the crime rate that has skyrocketed since you all stirred up the embers of the race war issue that had been slowly dying for a few decades. The cops really dont have time to be writing citations for this kind of thing. The municipalitieswhat, is the goal to fine them out of existence? Dont answer that. Backyard grilling is how a lot of us survive in the summer. Normally this summer is an exception in these parts since its a flood year one cooks on the grill mainly to keep the house from heating up with the oven. (Gotta love natural gas. Yeah, that in-ground grill is not a luxury item.) That just makes the air conditioning run more. More AC uses more electricity, which is in short supply as it is since the regime has decided we cant burn coal anymore. When it comes to fireworks, both the legal small stuff and the huge displays put on by cities from sea to shining sea, uh, yeah, see it was John Adams, second president of the United States and signer of the Declaration of Independence, who said that we would forever be lighting bonfires and illuminations on this day. The regime wants to break a 239 year old tradition for the sake of a little ozone that will naturally dissipate just like it always has? Oh, yeah, thats a brilliant idea. No more oohs and ahhs for a country that defied the odds when it sent the overlords packing and not only survived, but became the most powerful nation on earth. Thats one way to work on demoralization. The Daily Caller points out that such a move as limiting ozone would cost a lot of construction jobs and force manufacturers to find other places to make their products. Thats a sector of the economy the USA cant afford to lose. As it is, the latest ozone rule standards are unenforceable and there are still places not in compliance. And, for Heavens sake, it is so freaking unnecessary. According to the EPA itself, surface ozone has been falling on its own for thirty years and will reduce further with no changes: Americans are breathing easier than they have in decades and, if the EPA just leaves things alone, ozone levels will drop another 36 percent by 2025. There is simply no need for President Obama and the EPA to kill jobs, destroy the economy and end Independence Day as we know it for the sake of irrational and unnecessary new environmental standards. And yet the environmental stooge, Gina McCarthy gave it a shot anyway. She tried to con Congress into passing the rule. So far they havent taken her up on it. Yeah, well out here on the fruited plain, Obama regime, you can take your EPA ozone standards and shove it. Youre messing with the Fourth of July, the nations birthday. This is one of just two days that have been with Americans from the beginning where we celebrate all together. (Memorial and Labor came considerably after the 4th and Thanksgiving, even if Thanksgiving kept moving for the first 80 years or so.) Its a day of relaxation and good, old American style food and yes that includes a whole lot of dead animal flesh. (Grilling fruit? WT#? That would ruin perfectly good watermelon.) It could even mean roasting marshmallows over a bonfire and making the greatest of American camping treats smores. For many of us, its a celebration of one of the tastiest animals God put on this earth pork. (Seriously, give me bacon or give me death could be slogan in this house.) Mess with surface ozone and risk the wrath of dissident patriotic Americans who are crossing the days off the calendar until we can vote this regime into the dustbin of history. Obama, dont even try to fundamentally change the Fourth of July. The people just will not stand for it. ",3

2,"Pokemon Go Causes Mayhem In Yet Another Area Pokemon Go has been all over the news and social media lately. Some people think the new app is a ridiculous waste of time while others are clinging to the idea of recapturing their childhood. Whatever the case, New York Citys Central Park was swarming with eager participants after a rare find was supposedly spotted at the infamous city park. Due to the games system of drawing players into real world locations to catch the various kinds of Pokemon, there have been occasions where a crowd has formed to obtain a rare part of the Pokedex. A video released Friday, which you can see below, shows trainers rushing into Central Park late Thursday night to catch the rare Eevee evolution, Vaporeon. A similar situation played out Wednesday, July13 in Bellevue, Washington.Hundreds of players stormed a park when Squirtle, another rare Pokmon, appeared there. Pokemon Goisnow the biggest mobile game in U.S. history, and is available on iOS and Android. This is hilarious to watch people stampede around to find a virtual creature. Even more hilarious is the GROWN MEN that are playing this game. Seriously is there nothing better you could be doing with your time?

2,"162 Lost At Sea on Flight QZ8501 At 7:24AM (6:24PM Saturday EST time) on Sunday flight QZ8501 to Singapore disappeared. It was lost somewhere over the Java Sea. There was no distress signal sent. The flight was going from Indonesia to Singapore. It was halfway through its 2 hour flight when it lost contact with air traffic control. There were 162 people aboard the plane, including 7 crew members, 18 children, one being an1 infant. Search parties, have been scouring the areas of Borneo and the Java Sea, but bad weather conditions have hindered the search.No wreckage has been found yet. There is some speculation that the plane might be at the bottom of the Java Sea. The pilot did ask for permission to deviate from the course due to bad weather. Ministry official Djoko Murjatmodjo said the request could not be approved at that time due to traffic, there was a flight above, and five minutes later [flight QZ8501] disappeared from radar. There is speculation that the pilot did try to ascend anyway to avoid thick storm cloud, but no one is sure what happened after he asked for permission. Strong, severe storms were reported in the area during the time the pilot requested permission. The pilot of flight QZ8501has had over 20,500 flight hours with nearly 7,000 of those hours being with AirAsia. The families of the 162 passengers are anxiously waiting to hear any word about the fate of their loved ones. There was a briefing for the families with airport officials at the airport in Surapaya, Indonesia. Officials are trying to keep the media away from the families while they await news and keep them as comfortable as possible. As bad weather has hindered the search, but the weather looks like it will be good enough to continue the search today. With over 12 hours missing , officials are becoming more worried. This is the 3rd tragic loss for Asia aviation. Two other flights have been lost this year, flights MH307 and MH17. MH307 has never been recovered and MH17 was shot down over Ukraine with no survivors. There is no link between the 3 flight tragedies. ",4
2,"Referring To A Man As A Man Is A Crime If Hes Pretending Hes A Woman How did it get to be that one persons delusion or mental condition about their gender has to be embraced by all of those they come into contact with as a reality that it is not? Even more absurd and frightening to those still anchored to life in the real worldis the fact that there can be serious legal ramifications for failing to deny the truth by playing along with the charade. Bolton is former mill town located in Greater Manchester in North West England. One of the city council members, Zoe Kirk-Robinson, is a man who claims that he transitioned from male to female ten years ago. Hes all butt-hurt because another councilman used the appropriate male pronoun to reference him. Theres more to being a woman than long hair, a unisex name, heels and a pantsuit and presumably more to a transition. As long as its obvious or even suspected that he might be a man can he really claim to have transitioned? Hes cross dressing, role-playing or something along those lines, okay, more power to you buddy. Its your right and your life. But dont expect others to share your fantasy or even to give a darn. Youre not transitioning into a woman but if thats what you want to believe, knock yourself out. Even Bruce Jenner still looked like a man after surgery and pills. The nature of the crime that Kirk-Robinson is accusing former Bolton mayor Guy Harkin of committing is that of misgendering, him repeatedly, something he describes as a personal attack. Failing to share in his delusion is not an attack, it is an observance of the reality of the situation. He could play along if he so chose to, but how can he be legally required to deny the truth? Apparently he can in jolly old England, as the Manchester Police are investigating the incident as a hate crime. This world truly is upside down and perversion is the new normal. All of the Looney Tunes in power that are accusing Harkin of the horrific crime of misgendering should have the sense to realize that had he addressed the man Kirk-Robinson as a female, he would have then been misgendering and that Robinson is actually misgendering himself. In keeping with what is the typical response of the left to being called on their lunacy and hypocritical projections, the sexually confused man went on offense, taking the position that he is the normal one and those clinging to reality are defective transphobic for opting not to join him in his fantasy. Robinson tweeted I cant say Im surprised at his behavior but I had hoped that Boltons leading political group wasnt transphobic. He also tweeted, I will be calling on Bolton Labor Group to denounce his behavior. Bolton does not welcome transphobia. Harkin isnt exhibiting a phobia, hes not afraid of the trans-dude aside from the potential legal consequences. How about a new label, something like trans dont give a crap or trans just shut the hell up to describe their unwillingness to pretend hes something he isnt and that hes nothing more thanan annoying and desperate little man seeking attention in any way possible. Robinson posted a video blog saying, If Im truthful, it hurt a lot. The guy had no reasons to ever suggest that I was male, he has never met me as a male. I transitioned over 10 years ago and I have lived in Bolton for seven, going on eight years, he never met me before I transitioned. If Robinson really wants to be truthful, hell have to admit hes the one denying reality, not the ex-mayor. As for Harkin having no reasons to ever suggest that Robinson was male, the reasons are everywhere. Pick up a mirror, Mr. Robinson. And the fact that you started pretending to be a woman before he met you is meaningless. Go ahead, look in the mirror. The motivation behind Robinsons attack on Harkin becomes clear when you realize he prides himself as A campaigner for gay and transgender rights, and a hate crime ambassador who is part of a local police-council partnership. Hes looking for an issue and a little notoriety, pressing his cause of forcing people to submit to his declarations of falsehoods as truth. Its about licensing himself to control the actions of others, a manifestation of the typical liberal lefts power addiction. Kirk-Robinson admitted he has gotten the police involved, saying, The incident has been referred to Greater Manchester Police, and therefore is now out of my hands. As a hate crime ambassador, I always urge people to report hate crime when it occurs and I will continue to do so. In other words, dont mess with him. Avoid a problem and give him whatever he wants; hes going to start demanding special favors. Harkin, 69, insists that the use of the wrong correct pronoun to reference Robinson was accidental and not intended as an attack. He said, I was utterly unaware of this slip of the tongue until it was pointed out to me the day after the meeting. I offered immediately to apologize as there is not a homophobic or any kind of phobic bone in my body. Its not about you, Mr. Harkin, its about power; youre just a tool the leftist is using to get what he wants. ",3
2,"Kerry Full Speed Ahead As If UN Climate Deal Is Law, Not So Fast, Johnny Boy One of the tools the globalist anti-Americans within the Obama regime, Obama, Johnson and Kerry in particular, utilize as the means by which to manipulate the public is to make a declaration and then treat it as if it is written in stone. It can be and often is completely illegal or at the very least illegitimate, that doesnt slow them down in the least. That was the case with the Iran deal which required as 2/3 majority in Congress to ratify it, a constitutional requirement they simply sidestepped by changing the label on the treaty to something else. They did the same thing with the Paris COP21 climate hoax agreement and the Sustainable Development 2030 UN agreement. Its also the method that Obama utilized when he and President Xi of China deposited their signed climate agreements with the UN when Obama attended the G20. The Senate must ratify treaties for them to be valid but Obama considers himself to be above either the Constitution or his co-equal partners in the legislative branch. Knowing that Congress and the American people would not approve of his plan to destroy America by green fascism, he simply declared a new power, that of self-ratifying his own treaty. He called it an executive agreement to get it concluded and intends to simply act as if it had the power of a treaty. Thats what dictators do. Now theyve got this elaborate scheme where one day before the elections, on November 7th in Marrakech, Morocco, at the next climate summit, following the first trigger of 55 countries having supposedly ratified the climate hoax agreement, step two will kick in. That will be the ratification by nations totaling at least 55 percent of all global emissions. Obama and John Kerry are presenting their plan as being close to fruition based upon an illegitimate non-ratified American agreement. Our supposed 17.89 percent that he and his fellow globalist pirates are counting as part of the total approved is a bogus number that cannot be included in their totals and they know it. Theyre going to continue with the farce and, as usual, daring Congress to stop them. They know that a Trump victory puts them out of business but the COP21 agreement was written with a four year exit period. That applies if its legitimately ratified, which it was not but the globalists are putting up the charade that it was. Theyre pretending to be fighting the clock to get Mr. Trumps hands tied but thats a false argument. The clock hasnt started and it wont. Nobodys hands are tied, theres no such thing as self-ratifying an agreement. A treaty requires 2/3 Senate approval, period. The video below is John Kerry laying it on thick, dismissing what he knows to be the reality. Its always the way these crooks operate, they do as much as they can get away with and then incessantly come back with one additional attack after another. Kerry made these latest comments at the U.N. General Assembly in New York, claiming he was absolutely confident the climate deal will enter into force. What he is is absolutely lying, an absolutely self-serving green pirate paving the way for post regime enrichment, and absolutely treasonous fraud.

2,"UN Says WikiLeaks Founder Julian Assange Is Being Unlawfully Detained Related To Rape On Thursday, a United Nations panel put the kabash on extradition of Julian Assange, the founder of WikiLeaks a website that has no qualms about publishing state secrets of any country from the United Kingdoms embassy in Ecuador to Sweden to face rape charges in that country. Assange made a complaint in 2014 to the UN Panel on Arbitrary Detention claiming that officials at the UK embassy looking to extradite him to Sweden had no call to detain him even if the Brits claimed it was their duty to do so. In the early hours of February 4, the UN panel sided with Assange. He is now free to leave the embassy, however, Swedish officials still want answers from Assange, who is Australian, and are working with the Ecuadorian police to arrange for questioning. The base reason, it is believed, for Assange fighting extradition to Sweden is his fear of eventually being extradited to the United States to face charges related to online publication of US government and military secrets. According to Vice News, it is assumed that a federal grand jury has convened and a case is being put together for Assanges prosecution. He believes the allegations are a politically motivated ruse that will ultimately result in him being extradited to the United States to press charges over his activities with Wikileaks, which posts classified government documents online. Its believed there is a US Grand Jury investigation underway over the publication of US military and diplomatic documents. It is a factThe US Department of Justice has repeatedly confirmed that there is a pending prosecution,says the Wikileaks website. Ultimately, any UN panel as no control over Sweden, Ecuador, United Kingdom, or the United States, for that matter. However, the UN holds enough good will internationally to force the nations involved to at least allow Mr. Assange the freedom to move about Ecuador, where he has asylum while he is being questioned. In astatement posted on Twitter in the early hours of Thursday morning, Assange said:Should the UN announce tomorrow that I have lost my case against the United Kingdom and Sweden I shall exit the embassy at noon on Friday to accept arrest by British police as there is no meaningful prospect of further appeal. However, should I prevail and the state parties be found to have acted unlawfully, I expect the immediate return of my passport and the termination of further attempts to arrest me. The man is in South America. With a passport and freedom to move. ",4

2,"George Soros Jedi Mind Trick: Fear Of Jihad Breeds TerrorIt always becomes apparent that the hoi polloi groundswell is getting too close to the truth when would be Jedi Master, or in this case the Sith wannabe, decides to go public with a scolding. George Soros, the puppetmaster who doesnt even try to hide behind the curtain, in the wings, or at the top of the fly anymore, published an op-ed in United Kingdoms The Guardian taking the west to task for being trepid, to be generous about it, for not wanting hoards of muslim refugee migrants invading their countries. And that is exactly what is happening. The hysterical anti-Muslim reaction to terrorism is generating fear and resentment among Muslims living in Europe and America. The older generation reacts with fear, the younger one with resentment; the result is a breeding ground for potential terrorists. This is a mutually reinforcing, reflexive process. And, of course, we cant have this in an open society. Westerners fear and acting on that fear is what breeds terrorists, not the system of living that produces people who are willing to maim, harm, kill and terrorize humans, having no remorse for stealing other peoples belongings and using public welfare systems all while plotting to take down the local government and impose Sharia law which strips the locals of their rights, and denies them the privileges that fosters prosperity. Seriously, its like the man wants us to commit cultural suicide. (Yes, sarcasm is strong with this one.) So, according to George Soros, who exactly is the cause of this fear mongering that is upsetting all of the carefully crafted chaos of the bastardizedCloward-Piven Strategyfor social order making western life a quagmire and minefield of political correctness at the expense of the safety and security the western nations have come to expect? Donald Trump and Ted Cruz, of course. Abandoning the values and principles underlying open societies and giving in to an anti-Muslim impulse dictated by fear certainly is not the answer, though it may be difficult to resist the temptation. I experienced this personally when I watched the last Republican presidential debate; I could stop myself only by remembering that it must be irrational to follow the wishes of your enemies. But one idea shines through crystal clear: it is an egregious mistake to do what the terrorists want us to do. That is why, as 2016 gets underway, we must reaffirm our commitment to the principles of open society and resist the siren song of the likes of Donald Trump and Ted Cruz, however hard that may be. The rest of the op-ed/essay/scolding diatribe has to do with the Syrian conflict and how THAT is the root of the current disaster, not the wet noodle leadership of the west who are afraid of offending members of a quasi-religious government system that wants to render the west neutered. As for what the terrorists want, somehow is does not seem to be that they really want to be profiled, watched, put on no-fly lists, monitored, and otherwise be subjected to law enforcement surveillance let alone deported from the very countries they were sent to destroy. Thats what Trump and Cruz are discussing, not fear mongering, really. (The people are already afraid. Were looking for concrete solutions for keeping the homefront secure.) What Georgie doesnt quite appreciate when he tries to pull this Jedi mind trick stuff, is that the Ted Cruzes and the Donald Trumps of the world and many of their fans, admirers, and groupies are a lot smarter than your average Guardian reader for all of their sophisticated elegance. There are people out in the hinterland, outback, fruited plain, and various other places where the little people reside who actually DO read, do research, and do understand that one of the organizations fostering this large scale migration of refugees coming to the west armed with pretty expensive smart phones is bankrolled a few grant checks back by Soros himself. What todays op-ed demonstrates is Soros frustration that the larger faction of humans in first world countries arent buying the propaganda his machine is manufacturing. We get what you are trying to do, George. The total and complete dumbing down of the general public hasnt taken hold quite as deeply as will be necessary for as complete a takeover as the globalist, open society, one world sorts would like mainly because the regular people out there dont want an open society with a globalist one world New World Order. Our ancestors fought for and gave up a lot to have freedom FROM that. Why would we want to return to the oppression of the past? George Soros and his ilk who are trying these Jedi mind tricks have to remember that it might work on storm troopers, but didnt on the giant slug with the party barge. He had his own interest at heart. So do we who object to our safety and security being tossed out the window in favor of people coming to our shores to use our generosity against us. At this point, there is a history and a track record of such behavior beginning with 19 hijackers who used commercial airplanes to attack the United States and kill thousands of people all while trying to lay waste to the symbols of power that seem to generate resentment from the followers of Sharia. We the little people understand quite well where it is coming from, and the more we learn of Islam, and Sharia law we understand that the only way to rid ourselves of the scourge is to not allow it to take hold.

2,"VA Spying On Whistleblowers REPORT The Veterans Administration scandal erupted in 2015 with the public coming to know the backlog issues involved with veterans not being able to get timely appointments with physicians. One report even told of the number of veterans who died waiting for appointment. Now, the people who brought attention to the VA scandal are telling the world of another scandal within the scandal: they believe that the VA is diverting emails from the whistleblowers to administrators in Washington and Atlanta. The House Veterans Affairs Committee has received a complaint from an anonymous VA whistleblower who had trouble sending a work email to her personal email, after which an IT worker told her the VA was blocking certain email functions. A further investigation revealed a list of other VA employees with similar restrictions, which appears to include known VA whistleblowers from around the country. The list of names was titled Sec Divert Internal, and the anonymous whistleblower told the [Washington]Examiner that the IT worker believes emails from those workers are being sent to the VA secretarys office in Washington, D.C. Naturally, the VA denies this is the case. However, the Sec Divert Internal list includes the name of an employee, Scott Davis, who testified before Congress on incompetence at the VA and is a regular on news shows covering the VA scandal story. A screenshot provided to the Washington Examiner confirms that his emails are going to someone, somewhere, in addition to his intended recipient. Coincidence? Its a possibility, but considering not all whistleblowers are known names, and the reality that they have been threatened and NOTHING has happened in the Veterans Administration to fix the problems brought to light by the people disgusted enough to speak up, not really likely. Scott Davis claims to have had email problems for a while. So do others who have reported on abuses in the VA, which have not dissipated. The VA says that the list title has been changed, claiming that the word divert was misleading, and that they were HELPING the heroes. Davis isnt buying it. Davis said outright it was horse st. Its clear in my estimation that none of this had anything to do with helping whistleblowers, he said. I would argue it had the exact opposite intent, which is retaliating. Davis added some other news that is rather telling in this entire affair. He sends email complaints directly to VA Secretary Bob McDonald. Davis provided the Examiner with another screenshot of the delivery status of the emails. Note that they have not been read. Another screen shot proves that Davis emails are going toDebi Bevins, staff director for the office of the secretary in Washington. In the Examiner article, another whistleblower claims that employees are watched for interaction between them and members of Congress. This person claims to have been put on unpaid leave after a recent meeting. This whistleblower added that its disturbing to be on a special list of emails that appear to be going to VA headquarters in Washington, and said that seems to go directly against the VAs pledge not to harass or intimidate whistleblowers. And while the VA says its trying to help, this whistleblower said he takes no comfort in that. Should I be flattered or creeped out? this whistleblower said in an interview. Are they spying on my work email, or keeping me from reporting abuses to Secretary McDonald? These whistleblower experiences are VERY disturbing to the general population who were all hoping that with the exposure of the less than best practices at the VA, the abuses would be investigated and stopped. But no. The entrenched bureaucrats are more interested in protecting themselves and running interference with the boss than they are actually fixing the culture they perpetuate. The House of Representatives Veterans Affairs Committee is investigating the whistleblowers claims. We will see where this leads. ",3
2,"WIKILEAKS BOMBSHELL: Assange Talks About Murdered DNC Staffer Life in American politics is officially getting dangerous. Moreso than even when Allen Dulles was fired as the head of the CIA, but still ran the place. On July 10, the American political establishment elected officials, hangers on and the media were stunned when a young man by the name of Seth Rich was murdered in his Washington, D.C., neighborhood in the wee hours of the morning. Seth Rich just happened to be the voter expansion data director for the Democratic National Committee. Rich was shot twice in the back in what DC police have speculated was a robbery gone badexcept he still had his cell phone, watch and wallet. (Hmm) In the succeeding days, right before the DNC Convention in the not so aptly named City of Brotherly Love, Philadelphia, Julian Assanges Wikileaks released a whole lot of DNC emails that proved the Democrats submarined Bernie Sanders candidacy, were in cahoots with all sorts of mainstream media types, and basically forced out Debbie Wasserman-Schultz as chairman/woman/person. On Tuesday August 9, the plot thickened. Wikileaks is offering a $20,000 reward for information on the murder of Seth Rich. The journalist organization, which specializesin releasing classified or secret information, offered a $20,000 reward Tuesdayto anyone with information on the murder of DNC staffer Seth Rich. His murder is the subject of multiple conspiracy theories, including one which allegeshis death was retribution from the DNC for helping Wikileaks obtain party emails showing evidence of favoritism during the Democratic primary between Hillary Clinton and Bernie Sanders. WikiLeaks has decided to issue a [$20,000]reward for information leading to conviction for the murder of DNC staffer Seth Rich, read a tweet from the organization. The announcement was made via Twitter and once again opened the lines for conspiracy theorists and the Clinton Body Count to question if Rich indeed was the leak. (One of the Clinton Body Count sources speculates that Rich was on his way to talk to the FBI when he was murdered.) If that wasnt enough, on Tuesday, Julian Assange himself, the founder of Wikileaks appeared on Dutch television hmming and hawing around the question of Rich being the leak. Watch: As uncomfortable as this video is, it should give all Americans pause. Wikileaks sources take tremendous risks to get information out to the public. We know that. Seth Rich was obviously murdered for some reason other than robbery. Assange all but says Seth Rich was a source, and he died for it. Wikileaks had to get those emails from someplace. This could very well be the case. ",3
2,"Obama Administration Regulations On Fireworks Completely Insane Its that time of year. Time for the kids both young and old to head to the fireworks stand just across the county line and load up on sparklers, snakes, bottle rockets, Roman candles, poppers, and all the other neato cool pyrotechnic paraphernalia that makes the modern Fourth of July the Fourth of July. This week, the executive director of the American Pyrotechnic Association, Julie Heckman, sat down with Politico to talk about what it takes to stockpile the close to $1 billion industry ahead of the Fourth of July. When asked about the Obama Administrations approach to regulation, she said: Ive been working with the industry for a very long time, 26 years. I have never seen as many rulemaking initiatives as I have with this administration. It has just been completely insane. You know, Im not saying its necessary, but it would be really great when take a tiny industry like fireworks, and weve got to comply with ATF, CPSC, EPA, OSHA, multiple divisions of the Department of Transportation, its really challenging. It would be great if we could have one agency that took care of everything, and Im sure there are other industries that are also feeling that pain, but it has been very significant. Heckman listed specific challenges as things like a constant revolving door of agents working for the various government departments which require a whole new getting to know you time period in order to educate the new person on the industrys concerns, and limits on times truck drivers could be on the road. She also discussed the extensive testing done on legal fireworks sold to the public. The industry has been very committed to working with the foreign manufacturers over in China. In fact, through the APA, another organization was created, the American Fireworks Standards Laboratory, which is a third-party certification organization. They actually test the product in China to make certain that not only does it meet the Consumer Product Safety Commission regulations, it exceeds them, because AFSL standards go a step beyond what the federal government mandates. And you know, the product has improved significantly, so were very proud of that. Like the amusement park industry, it sounds like the fireworks people do their own due diligence when it comes to safety. On roller-coasters, the motto is its no fun if people get hurt, and most injuries happen when riders get out of the safety restraints after the ride has started. In fireworks, the same standard applies which is why Heckman stresses the difference between legal and illegal products. Last year, 11 people were killed and more than 10,000 people injured in fireworks-related accidents,according to a Consumer Products Safety Commission report. Most of the injuries were burns due to malfunction or misuse. Three of the deaths were bystanders who died in fires or from smoke inhalation. , said many fireworks injuries are due to illegal fireworks, which lack quality control and can produce powerful explosions. When you read articles that people lost their hand, that was an illegal firecracker,Heckmansaid. A legal one has 50miligramsof explosives, which is enough to sting but not enough to blow your digits off. To Politico on this topic, Heckman said, We look at the consumption, the overall usage of backyard consumer fireworks has increased significantly during the past decade, and when you look at the use of fireworks and compare then the number of injuries, actually, the injury rate has declined. Im not aware of one other consumer product on the market today where the usage has risen so dramatically, yet the injuries have gone down. And yet the Obama Administration has the industry dealing with at least five government agencies, each charged with regulating a different aspect of life in the United States. Just like multiple other industries, fireworks manufacturers and wholesalers are being regulated out the ying-yang. Unlike the others, pyrotechnics are not a large enough industry to be much of an influence in getting all the rule making to stop. At this time, fireworks are legal in 47 of the 50 states mostly thanks to the tax revenue they generate. Delaware, Massachusetts and New Jersey are the holdouts. ",4

2,"What Liberals Demand Parents Do This Christmas is UNBELIEVABLE, And They Are Fighting To Make This A LAW! We all know that the left has never been silent when it comes to how they feel you should raise your children. They have a strong belief that they know better than you when it comes to your kid. This Christmas, liberals are adding a new demand to their long list of complaints. They have started a campaign titled No Gender December. The goal is to stop parents from buying toys that gender stereotype their children, and stop children from playing with gender based toys. From the No Gender December website: Christmas brings a myriad of catalogues and gift guides selling kids toys. Many toy retailers use gendered marketing which influences children and consumers alike, by sending strong messages about the appropriateness of their choices. Color codes, labels and imagery all have a narrowing effect on our childrens perspectives. The article linked to the website talks about how much boys need feminism as well. The writer claims that we need to do more to educate parents and teachers. She is upset about kids being segregated by gender at school, like seating children in boy, girl arrangements or lining up in boy, girl lines. I guess it isnt enough to ban gender bias toys, now they dont even want teachers to refer to your child as a certain gender. It is all part of a new trend liberals have created called gender neutral parenting. Under this new style of parenting, you dont teach your child that they are a boy or a girl, you ask THEM what gender they feel they are at that moment. The whole thing sounds ridiculous to me, but millions of people actually take this stuff seriously. This craziness has gone all the way to the United Nations. Mother Thea Hughess group Play Unlimited started the campaign, which she says has the support of the UN Convention on the rights of the child. These nuts are not just complaining; they are trying to pass legislation to stop gender-based marketing all over the world. Campaigners are calling for blue and pink toy aisles to be scrapped, and federal legislation to stop advertisers showing only boys or girls playing with particular toys. if you stand up to pee your male, if you sit down to pee your female whats the confusion?? There, theyre, their, grammar Nazis, calm down. Everything will be ok. there are boys and girls ,no matter what these liberal ass holes say ,stay away from my kids Liberals own all the ghettos and if a city does not have on they will make one. That shows just how much they know about raising you kids. Just helping the real Liberal with his reading Anne Dear. Calm down. Screw the Liberals, its time to go to war against their entire agenda! Conservatives have sat on the sidelines long enough. Enough is enough and this just crossed that line. Well at least I know how to have a conversation without having to name call and use profanity. Have a nice life And what part of my comment do you object to? Do I not have the right to object to the whole gay agenda being forced on us? Do you feel that I dont have the right to express the opinion that homosexuality is perverted and wrong? Gender neutrality is more of the same gay garbage that is an abomination and an affront to people of nearly all major religions. What they, or you, do in the privacy of your bedroom is your choice. All I ask is that you keep it there, not force it upon the rest of us. Liberalism is a Mental and Social Disease, and should be treated as such. More liberal focus on the trivial? Why dont you address the issue instead of nitpicking? If you wouldnt say something in a real world public place, then it shouldnt be said in a public internet place. Lets be honest about the existence of the internet, it is real. Just because something is posted on the internet rather than said out loud doesnt make discretion any less important. I dont mean to pile on Pamela, but if her children were a little older (Im only guessing at their ages based on her photo), they could easily find her internet history and see what she wrote. Its entirely likely that they wouldnt be able to discern that she was just venting and would then get the message that its okay to round up and kill people just for having different political views. I think that we can all agree that a world where the next generation believes this to be true is not a place that we want to be. It is equally important to consider comments made on the internet as it is comments made in person. Pamela, I appreciate that youre not serious about rounding people up, I just dont see the fact that it was on the internet as an excuse for why its okay to say it even if you dont mean it. I think it is important to note that this whole thing is about neutrality, and affects advertisers and not parents. The point of this is that if Barbies and G.I. Joes are both packaged in the same color (or at least gender neutral colors), then children wont subconsciously get the message that Barbies are for girls and G.I. Joes are for boys. This does nothing to affect how parents raise their children. It actually gives parents MORE freedom to raise their children how they see fit by removing some of the influences that advertisers have over their children. So, to everyone claiming that the left is trying to tell me how to raise my kids, thats just incorrect. Whats going on here is that some people from one end of the political spectrum are trying to give you more power over the advertisers that have managed to wiggle their way into all the other aspects of your life. Please, for all of our sakes, just calm down and think about this for a few moments longer. Wow, just wow. Talk about keeping crappy ideas to themselves in the privacy of their bedrooms. In all fairness, youre right about their being much bigger problems. However, the people mentioned in this article arent telling anybody how to raise their children, theyre telling advertisers how to advertise. Also, just because something isnt in the top 20 list of problems does that mean that nobody should try and fix it? Im pretty sure there are people trying to fix child abuse as well. Advertising messes with peoples kids in much more harmful ways than a bill that doesnt actually change anything for children or parents. This proposed bill will affect what marketing companies would use, not what parents can buy for their children or what children can choose to want. So actually, once you consider whats being proposed, nobody is messing with you or your kids. Its also worth noting that this bill will affect ADVERTISERS and not PARENTS. That, I believe, is the root of Davids comment. The left (as a whole) is not crazy enough to try to push into law that parents cant buy pink stuff for girls, theyre pushing for law that marketing must be gender neutral. The right (in part, not everyone) is being crazy by misrepresenting what is going on and getting people all riled up about it. Not sure if you understand how rights work. I have the right to voice my offense. Thats it. I understand that me being offended means nothing to you, but perhaps it will mean something to somebody else. And by the way, claiming to be middle of the road means that some of the time you agree with the conservative agenda and sometimes you agree with the liberal agenda. It means that youd rather use your own mind when concerning an issue, rather than just toe the party line. Im sorry that you have such a narrow view of the world, it doesnt serve you well, and it doesnt serve the other people who live in this world with you well. You need to be fucking ashamed because youre advocating murdering people by firing squad for having a different political view from you. Youre also (intentionally or not) teaching this view to your children, which means its going to be perpetuated in the world. Thats not just shameful, thats fucking shameful. These stupid perverts keep trying to screw kids and families up. Let the kids play with whatever toys they want, and the gayfascists should keep their crappy ideas to themselves in the privacy of their bedrooms and out of our livingrooms. I ALWAYS bought Gender Neutral things for my son, even 25 years ago . . . . Musical Instruments !!! Tell liberals to F-OFF my kids make a list of what they would like and I base buying gifts from those list no dreaming lib is going to tell me what to buy for my kids! Wow, thats very Christian of you. My son and daughter both played with trucks and Legos. My son never felt a desire to play with a doll, but he did have several stuffed animals as a kid. Both of them turned out pretty damn well, if I do say so. United Nations should be concerning itself with children in this world who are enslaved, getting their genitals mutilated and being bought and sold for sex. not whether or not I buy my daughter a girl toy or not! Stupid, Worthless, POS, alleged organization! Our Constitution is the Supreme Law of Our Land! First, Foremost, Always!! Screw a UN! We dont need em! Jus sayin Anyway* So I guess if a boy wants a dress for Christmas they promote this too right!! This is a bunch of crap Theyre playing with fire when it comes to messing with peoples kids. I checked the site out. And found onaround 1400 individuals that took their pledge. Its like saying theres something wrong with being a boy or girl. They want a metrosexual socieity. Why is it wrong to raise a boy to be a boy? Or heaven forbid raise a girl to be a girl. Theres some twisted minds out in the world. Has so many lost the concept of reality. I was such a tomboy in childhood. Wanted nothing to do with dolls or anything and my momma respected that. I turned out just fine and actually wear pink on occasion (rare). Liberals need to mind their own business. Oh my aching a$$, why dont they just mind their own business and let parents raise their own children. Heres the issue though and why I feel some may be offended, my self included. Im absolutely tired of all of this left-right bs that goes on. Why cant we all get along? Why do we have to stereotype everyone? As a Left, Liberal I think this article, and supposed bill, is absolutely insane! Yet in your comments here, you lump me into the same category as these people, just because Im Liberal? In my humble opinion, that is a true testament to ignorance. And Karen who initiated the above postLoad all Libs into a rocket ship, send them to their own planet!!?? Really? If I was as narrow minded and intolerant, I might suggest we do the same for those who stereotype via ignorance. But then I supposed Id be just like you. Ignorance Pamelaenough said! David, Amen!!! See my post above! So sick of left-right BS! Its so ignorant and petty. As a Liberal parent, I am far from the lunacy mentioned in this article! Im sure if we had time to waste, we could find articles on Right Wing Conservative parents pushing lunacy as well. Dont stereotype the masses based on a few! Quit lumping liberals into one group! Im liberal at times, and conservative on occasion too! What Im sick of is this left-right banter BS that YOU keep stereotyping us into! As a more liberal parent, my daughter is well rounded and quite a well raised kid! And guess whats on HER Christmas list.spy gear, night goggles, a scooter and Air Hogs! Being a Liberal doesnt automatically make us a bad parent, or worthy of being lumped into this lunacy of an article!! Get over yourself and your Right Wing crap! I am so sick to death of liberal lunatics trying to mandate how other people should raise their children. I was and still am a tomboy at heart. Hated playing with any dolls or girlie crap. Still dont like fu fu stuff much at all. Having said that to force people to not have gender toys and call kids boys or girls is outrageous. Just stop it already. Why dont we focus on kids in poverty, or the ones being abused physically or sexually if we are really concerned about childrens welfare. Really what toys they play with isnt a concern that should even be on the top 20 list of problems facing the youth of the world. For the love of God whats next. Im afraid to find out. look up U.N. treaties and you will see for yourself I tried to post the link for you but it is still pending. These people are off their freakin rockers. Tell them all to piss off. What if they asked for for them? Would you then buy it for them? I figured has much! I try never to get offended by what some people say here as some times they are just venting and it does not mean anything for in the real world they would never do such a thing. No it does not mean you stand for nothing. What you stand for is all the good and sane stuff. I do not like abortion but I will not put my nose into others women business. What I want is for all women to have birth control as soon as they think they first want to have sex and if they do not want to tell their Parents for what ever reason so be it, they should be able to get it free if need be, and that will bring down the number of abortions. That is just one thing the middle of the road believe in. I believe Vets should get 100% free medical for life if they were injured in any way in battle and that includes PTSD. Well there is more for the middle believes in some of the right side and some of the left side and plain old common since. Sane people add their own punctuation! The Drama and Grammer Nazis are always a laugh. But like I said sane people get what you write and do not worry their heads over mistakes made. For the grammer mistakes etc. are a nothing problem when it comes to the REAL problems in the world today. Gender Neutral is crap! But giving girls more choices then just the house wife/Mommy toys to play with is short changing our Daughters and our Sons. I hope if your Daughter wants a truck and not a doll or your son wants a doll and not a truck for Christmas you are giving them what they want and not what you think they should want because they are a Girl and a Boy. But I do agree this Gender Neutral crap only confuses them. I am a Great Grand Mother now but I was raised by Parents and Grand Mother too. I was given many dolls and other girl toys for birthdays and Christmas. But I was and still am a Tom boy and my girl toys where like new when my half Sisters where born 10 and 12 years after me so they got them all to play with. If I wanted to play house I used my stuff animals and my real dogs and kitties. In fact I had one cat who would let me dress her up with doll clothes and push her around in the doll pram. I also played with my fave toys which were a bike and skates. I climbed trees, rode down the street on my bike with no hands and all kind of dare devil stunts that you think only boys do. What I am getting at is children will be what they will be if left alone to do what they want or do not want to do. True it is good that toy makers are giving girls more choices like they give boys. I gave my Grand Son and my Grand Daughter both doll strollers for Christmas one year. Now my Grand Daughter is what I call a Girly Girl loving pink and all girl stuff and my Grand Son is all boy ruff and tough she used her stroller to transport her baby dolls around the house he used his to transport is stuff teddy bear running around the house and ramming into his Sisters stroller. I did not get a Tom Boy like me until the one grand Daughter came along all the rest are proper boys who are little speed demons and the proper Girly Girls. Like I said Children will be what they will be but boys and girls should be given both views of the world so they can be what they want to be. Be a girl football player or a boy home decorator, a male nurse or a girl Pilot. All children should be given choices but we should back away and let them choose what they like , what they want. Oh the reason boys line up in one line and girls in another is because if you go and watch the children you will see the boys pushing and picking on each other and laughing and the Girls will be talking to each other and laughing to each other. Girls do not want to be in a line with the boys who push and shove and boys do not want to be in line with the girls who tell on them for picking on them. You got that? So do not force all the liberal thinking on kids let them be what ever they want to be and play with what ever they want to play with, do that and they will be what they want to be. When they pay my bills then i might take suggestions but until that time stay the f#%k out of my life and leave my kids alone they have their own personalitys, we dont want a know it all who wants This is utter stupidity. I raised 2 girls and 2 boys. The girls are now self reliant young women and the boys are self reliant young men.All can cook and all can hunt. All can clean toilets and all can work on their cars. They all played with dolls and all played with trucks but that doesnt change the fact that the girls are girls and the boys are boys. I raised them all that girls can do anything and so can boys just that girls are often more delicate and always more beautiful and are to be treated like the China where the boys are metal camping plates.both serve the same purpose but you dont treat the China like you do the plates I say tell them to kiss my ass, I will buy what I want and when I want for my kids. From what I can see, I do not want my kids being as screwed up as theirs. Look at the liberal side and look at their kids their a mess. To everyone I offended, I was being sarcastic about the firing squad, venting my frustrations and it was not my intention to upset anyone. I dont get whats so offensive about not delineating gender by color or genre of toy. If a girl wants to train with a gun, she shouldnt be forced to sport a Barbie logo on the barrel. And if a boy feels like playing with a homemakers set, why cant he have one that isnt covered in little flowers and shit? Girls shoot guns; boys cook and clean. Neither of them does either of those exclusively, so why should we program them through their Christmas presents to think that way? Wow, that escalated quickly. Not even talking about my feelings on this article. You really want to round people up and kill them? Simply because they think differently than you? Wow It was not my intention to offend anyone, especially a Vet, with my opinions of how I feel about this. Why do I need to be f***ing ashamed, wouldnt ashamed be enough? Ive never believed in the whole boy colors /girl colors thing or toys for boys and toys for girls thing just as Ive never believed in the mans work and womans work crap. Ill let a boy play with a baby doll as much as I will let a girl play with hotwheels and never think twice about it. Grant it I wont give a boy and female doll or a girl a male doll as some dolls are made with genitals these days and then boxes arent always labeled That being said, its no ones business how I raise my kids as long as they are not being abused or neglected. You liberal idiots need to first learn what the word liberal means before you label yourselves. My girls may take out the trash, mow the lawn and learn to change oil as well as my boys do and my boys may wash dishes, vacuum and learn how to cook and sew as well as my girls do but they do know what gender they are and why shouldnt they? My brothers and I played with both hotwheels and dolls as children. its the left that is pushing for itNOT THE RIGHT don`t worry Jessie.some people are going to complain regardless.. Since when did you get the right to not be offended. And by the way when people claim to be middle of the road, that just means youre a liberal who doesnt stand for anything. Im not going to buy my nephew a Barbie doll any more than Id buy a little girl G.I. Joe toys. Theyre kids let them be kids and if you want yours to be gender neutral. As a politically middle of the road disabled Veteran I find this offensive Pamela. I wouldnt want any money raised by killing people simply for being concerned about the children of our nation to contribute to my benefit in any way. You should be fucking ashamed of yourself. I was getting my kid ready for school so I didnt take the time to proofread my comment and anyways I always love how wonderfully irritated people become when my sentences run on and on and on or if I use the wrong too or when I write or too much or when I change from present tense to past tense and back again all in one sentence. Rocket ships are expensive, how about a good old fashioned firing squad. We could sell tickets for a chance to be on the squad and use the money raised to helps Vets or pay it toward our national debt. I thought this was too STUPID to be true but I have found numerous articles and the websites promoting this crap. Just keep breathing while reading her run-on sentence. Makes it easier. At least they could teach the kid punctuation.. i wish we could load all the libs onto a rocket ship, send them to their own planet, and let us have our own sane existence. These people have fruit loops for brains! Whatever is the zaniest, most nonsensical fantasy they can dream up, they decide to label necessary. Put these people in straight jackets and send them where they cannot hurt themselves or the rest of this planet. United Nations Convention on the rights of the child needs more attention gender neutral is the least of its dangers please discuss how they want to undermine our parental rights in the areas of discipline and religion and schooling and how if ratified we could be taken to court and our children could be removed from our care even based on something so small as the child disagreeing with their being grounded! Can we put these fruit loops on their own island, in the middle of the ocean, without a boat? Go to the website and see for yourself, they are lobbing for this to be Law Sometimes the claims of the Right are so crazy you just cant believe them. Show me the bill before I can believe that the Left is really as stupid as that. Remember you are trying to convince people who did not vote for Obama 365 times each election. These people are what is wrong in our country. It has been working for centuries and you want to change it. You see what you change did in 2008. Now we have loonies trying to change this country. SIT DOWN AND SHUT THE HELL UP. I have 2 children. Each gets their treatment as to whatever gender they were born. God made them what they are and thats how they are raised. Gender Neutral only confuses kids in an already confusing world. ",3

Not fast Eddy! This wouldnt be an issue if the population was growing! The young would outnumber the ageing by plenty! Uh Oh! Again!

2,"Kerrys Terrorist Nation Building May Have Hit A Snag John Kerry brought his manure spreader to a meeting in Paris with the new French Foreign Minister as well as diplomats from Britain, Germany and Italy. Kerry gave a speech in which cited the Syrian civil war as being the cause of the Islamic invasion of Europe, although most of the refugees are economic and not Syrian. Lying is what the Obama regime and apparently their European counterparts are joining with them in telling this tall tale. Its particularly important for Germany but France as well to sell the lie. They dont want to be accused of ruining their countries without a good reason. Obama and Kerry have been insistent that Assad must go for a long time, since shortly after they drew the pink line in the sand over chemical weapons and Russia joined in helping them make a laughing stock of themselves. Theyve learned a lot from their failure in installing the Muslim Brotherhood in Egypt and their rousing success in Libya, the Islamic paradise. Building on that Libyan model, theyre aggressively working against the clock to accomplish their regime change before leaving office. Assad must surrender; hell get the same protections they gave Gaddafi, no reason to cling to power. Kerry addressed the audience, telling them how strongly he supports the efforts of their UN puppets, saying there isnt a person standing there who doesnt understand how difficult the process is. Difficult does not necessarily equate with justified or proper. Kerry sounds miffed at the arrogance of the Foreign Minister of Syria. He was clearly trying to disrupt the process of the overtaking of their country by a cabal of Western nations in conjunction with their terrorist freedom fighter allies. Its not because of Gitmo that they hate us, Kerry, its because you people cant stop meddling in their affairs in your endless attempts to fundamentally transform their nation into what you want it to be. The freakish Secretary of State exposed some problems in the process by falling back on a posture of intimidation and thinly-veiled threats. He argued his case much too strongly for things to be going according to plan. He stressed the existence of weak commitments by Iran and Russia to an approach that dictates there must be a political transition and that we must move towards a presidential election at some point in time. The weak negotiating skills of the American A team is once again on display in Kerrys comments. Just as with the nuclear deal, Iran already has him tied up. The terminology of a political transition is open to broad interpretation. Likewise, a movement towards a presidential election could be something as insignificant and meaningless as having ballots printed which are never used. When Hell freezes over is technically a point in time, Mr. Secretary. Kerry says, If we dont want to be back here next year, or even the year after, facing a Middle East with even more refugees, even greater numbers of dead and displaced, even more suffering and erosion of hope, it is vital that people exert leadership and deliver on the cessation of hostilities. Comments like that indicate hes not getting the cooperation he expected or that nobody cares what he and his big- eared master say anymore. He goes on to spread another shovelful of his favorite organic substance before he goes, saying, In the long run, the only way to actually end this challenge of refugees is to end the Syrian civil war. What guarantee does Kerry purport to be able to offer that making room for his preferred Islamic extremists to replace Assad will stop Syrians from leaving their country? Havent Iraq and Libya taught them anything? Then again, judging from the current situation the regime has created in the United States, chaos is exactly what theyre looking for, of the extreme Islamic variety.

2,"Stockpile Your Chocolate! The Earth is Running Out... Hot chocolate, milkshakes, chocolate cake, chocolate frosting, brownies, candy, cookies, chocolate chips, pies, puddings Imagine a world without any chocolateFrightening, isnt it? Look out, preppers, theres a new kind of Doomsday coming round, and everyone better get prepared. A woman without chocolate? Make that millions of women who cant get chocolate Whew! Watch out, I doubt there will be many survivors left after that rampage! In all seriousness, two of the biggest names in the decadent dessert, Mars, Inc. and Barry Callebaut, are telling the world consumers are eating too much of it. They think that by 2030, the deficit could reach 2 million tons, citing last years deficit where consumers ate (or drank) about 70,000 tons more cocoa than was produced. They say the dry weather in areas where it is commonly grown, frosty pod fungal disease, the rising popularity of dark chocolate (which contains about 60% more cocoa than regular), and the fact that farmers are choosing to grow easier crops like corn and rubber have all led to this deficit. John Mason of Ghana-based Nature Conservation Research Council told the Independent that in 20 years, chocolate will be like caviar. It will become so rare and expensive that the average Joe just wont be able to afford it. Before you go choco-crazy, there is a bit of hope in this dark crisis (pun intended). According to Bloomberg, farmers in Costa Rica are working on several new cacao plant breeds that will be easier for farmers in other parts of the world to grow, breeds resistant to the damaging diseases that have wiped out so much of Womans Sanity Serum lately. However, they say it takes almost two years for the seedlings to produce fruit, and 10 more years for the flavor to get just right. Joseph Dutra, owner of Kimmie Candy Company, also gives women reason to hope. There wasnt a crop deficit this year. We had one of the biggest crops weve ever had in cocoa, but speculators have kept the market up high. Adding that things tend to balance themselves out after a period of time. The prices go up, more people will grow cocoa beans, prices go down, less people will grow and we have to raise prices back up so its sustainable. Though he did tell reporters chocolate prices will be going up come January, so if you want save a buck, start stockpiling. Firstly, a woman without chocolate is like a woman 3+/- days every month (to mens perceptions, LOL). ",3
2,"[Watch] Illegal School Kids Cost to Communities, More Govt-Forced Wealth Redistribution Cavuto and Moore claim the number is fifty thousand illegal alien children which will be descending like locusts upon our school systems within the next couple of weeks. Virtually every single one of them will be non-English speaking, requiring extra attention, and receiving financial support from the local community as well as the federal government. The numbers calculated by Stephen Moore relate specifically to the education costs and surely understate the overall financial impact. Vaccinations, for example, wont be part of the cost of education, but they will be required and they will be given for free, under some type of Obama, DHS or HHS mandate. Moore calculates the cost of education alone at over a billion dollars this year, with that fifty thousand number being one provided by U.S. government projections. Those numbers may well be much higher, given the inability of the American people to force a rogue administration to obey and enforce our immigration laws. That billion dollars is spread across the nation and the claim is that the federal government will be reimbursing the local communities for their costs, just as they pay up to $6,000 per household to warehouse the kids now. The fact that we pub a federal label on the wasted tax dollars doesnt make it any more responsible or any less offensive. Money being wasted on supporting border-crashers from other countries, whether it be state, local or a federal reimbursement is still money that is being taken away from legitimate needs of the American people and thrown at an unnecessary crisis of Obamas creation. Moore describes the people in most of these communities as accepting people who cant afford it. He inadvertently hit the nail on the head. The fact that so many people will go along with their criminal government and just accept what is dictated to them is exactly why we are in this mess. Previous generations, composed of a more patriotic, less apathetic and less socialistic citizenry would never have stood idly by as this type of madness was unleashed upon them. Americans need to be less accepting and more demanding of a government that is working day and night to destroy them and convert the previous understood exceptionalism associated with being an American into no different, no better than any other socialist nation.

2,"Judge Jeanine Doesnt Care If GOP Elites Likes Our Choices, Dont Cancel Our Votes Judge Jeanine asks, Do we really need to go through this again? No, shes dont talking about another revolutionary war, at least not directly and shes not yet gotten to that point, but the frustration is related to the same type of abuses as those which brought about the first one. The Republican establishment, desperate to stop Trump and Cruz, still working to nullify our vote. If ever there were a time to not take away our vote, says Judge Pirro, its now. At a time when more people than ever are invested and voting, you want to keep your status quo, the one where one hand washes the other and we pay for the soap. She goes on to discuss the indications by establishment insiders Karl Rove and Reince Priebus that they are going to do their best to ignore and cancel our votes. She plays a clip of Karl Rove on the Hugh Hewitt radio show in which he said, Donald Trump excites a lot of enthusiasm but he also excites a lot of anger within the Republican Party and outside of the Republican Party, and a fresh face might be the thing that could give us a chance to turn this election and win in November against Hillary. She mockingly says, You want a fresh face? Arent you the guy who kept bringing us one Bush after another? She then points out, RNC chair Preibus refuses to say whether the presidential nominee for Republicans will be one of the top vote getters, Trump or Cruz. He says the Republican nominee is going to be someone who is running. Judge Pirro asks, Now what does that tell you? That the party chair is not willing to say that the nominee will be one of the two top vote getters, the top two delegate winners? Instead he quotes Rule 40; that a candidate needs a majority of 8 states. She then whittles down the possible contenders that fit into the Priebus definition of who will be the nominee, coming up with John Kasich as the establishment GOP choice. That makes sense, hes open borders, open unfair and predatory trade against Americans, often accused of being more like a Democrat than a Republican. Hes perfect for the elites who need a puppet candidate in each party. Kasich is also being financed heavily by George Soros, another of the inconvenient truths that dont get any coverage in the liberal media. Judge Pirro notes that rule 42 identifies rules 26 thru 42 to be temporary in nature, changeable at any time, in any manner, without any redress and in order to benefit certain candidates and their sponsors. She says the RNC rules are teed up for the convention rigging. They can nullify whatever occurs before the convention and the 2012 rules that are now in place dont necessarily apply to this convention. The RNC and rules committee has the power to change the rules and theres no way to challenge the results, no opportunity to go to court. The fix is in. She blasts them for attempting to invalidate the votes of Americans who waited in line to exercise their right to vote and then arbitrarily nullifying it in favor of someone the elites feel will help them better exercise their power. She asks, Whatever happened to your vote matters? Judge Pirro adds, Not since the American revolution has the ruling class tried so hard and so blatantly to take away our vote. Speaking to the RNC elites she asks, Do you not recall when we dissolved the political ties that bound us to the monarchy, when they strayed from all ideals of equity and fairness? A primer to the establishment, we dont get our rights from government. Government derives its power from the consent of the governed. She adds, Honestly, I dont care what you think of our choice or whether you like our favorites or not. Like everyone else, I will not be a puppet on a string, so stop trying to pull our strings.

2,"White Couple Attacked by Thugs as Knock Out Game Trend Runs Wild, This is Where to Avoid Many think the racist black on white knock out game is a thing of the past, but they are wrong. The knock out game is still very real and its even increasing in some areas. If you live in the D.C area, avoid the D.C Metro! FOX 5 DC reported: Two more victims have come forward in another violent attack at a Metro station. It is the latest in a string of violent assaults happening in the transit system. I dont know exactly what was happening, said one of the victims. I heard my girlfriend screaming. It was 15 seconds of terror for a D.C. couple after they were attacked by a group of teenagers on Metro. I think there were about ten kids who were just all attacking us, said the girlfriend. It was 9:30 p.m. Saturday night on January 2. The couple was waiting for a train at the Metro Center stop after spending a night at the movies. They were sitting on a bench when he was sucker-punched from behind and suffered a loss of vision. It all happened very quickly, and then they were just hitting us both in the face and head, said the female victim. They said the attack was unprovoked. We literally said nothing to them, said the boyfriend. The male victim had two black swollen eyes, welts on his head and bruised wrists from shielding his face. His girlfriend was left bleeding with a split lip. This is the forth attack just this last month on white Metro passengers. These young men and women are not interested in robbing their victims, they are out for blood. The media wants to ignore these attacks but doing so just puts more innocent lives in danger. This racist hate crime game needs to stop and its up to us to speak out. ",1
2,"OBAMACARE: Did Marco Rubio REALLY Set Death Spiral In Motion Back on the homefront regarding chronic and pressing domestic issues not related to immigration and veterans affairs, theres this little thing called the Affordable Care Act, or as we Americans not so affectionately call it: ObamaCare It was supposed to solve all sorts of health insurance issues when it was ramrodded through Congress in 2010 before anyone knew what was in it. The Speaker at the time did say it had to be passed to find out. Well, here we are, a little past five years later, and the insurers, the people who pool all that protection and racket money from their victims, uh, customers that pays out when one goes to the doctor OR has a major medical event, are fleeing the state exchanges that were supposed to advertise affordable insurance like rats off of a sinking continent. Why? Most people are thinking that it was just the weight of the law finally calling TIMBER! on the pricing. But the truth is that the built in subsidies that would keep the exchanges going despite the high prices to consumers that werent going to be bought and essentially provide annual bailouts to the insurance companies AND the state exchanges for their participation were severely undercut by a rider put into place in a budget deal two years ago thanks to one Senator Marco Rubio. From The Hill: The angst in the industry centers on an obscure program in the healthcare law known as risk corridors that was designed to shield insurers against losses. Rubio in 2013 went on the warpath against the program, decrying it as a taxpayer bailout. He penned op-eds against it, testified about it as the star witness at a House Oversight Committee hearing and even made his case to top House Republicans including then-Speaker John Boehner (R-Ohio). There is a problem with the way [ObamaCare] exchanges are now designed that have not yet received the attention they deserve, but I promise youre going to be hearing a lot about it in the days to come, Rubio said in a Senate floor speech in early 2014. While Rubios attempt to scrap risk corridors altogether was unsuccessful, his push contributed to a policy rider that was inserted into a 1,603-page spending bill passed at the end of 2014. Under the provision, which is still in effect, the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) could no longer tap other accounts such as its overall appropriations or its Medicare funding to fund the risk corridors program. This year, the fed can pay thirteen cents per dollar lost. The co-ops which were billed as the affordable option could not afford to operate on that and closed. For people actually in the insurance business, that kind of reimbursement aint going to cut it. The risk corridors program cannot fund itself (or be budget-neutral), and because of that Rubio rider which says HHS cant cannibalize from other pots of money to prop up the exchanges, the federal government cannot guarantee to cover losses as the insurers incur them while we all are trying to navigate through the minefield of ObamaCare. The insurers are cutting those losses and getting out before any more damage can be done to their bottom lines. (A year early, but well take what we can get.) Ed Morrissey over at HotAir calls this spike to the heart of the hot air balloon of ObamaCare mundane, like a Monday detail. Maybe, but not every ship sinks due to hitting an iceberg, or running into a sea wall. Rubio is right: if ObamaCare was ever going to work, the risk corridors should not be needed. The fact that there were built in bail-outs to the system should be rather telling. So, did Rubios rider in the 2014 budget deal trigger the death spiral that the ObamaCare exchanges are now experiencing? It is an interesting question. But, more importantly, the death spirals are going to yield a choice for the American government and people, not necessarily in that order. Single payer, which is a socialist/Democratic wet dream, or scrap the whole thing and go with market forces including health savings accounts, catastrophic insurance options, and insurance pools for those who want them. And THAT right up there with choices for potentially open Supreme Court Justice slots should be one of the more important deciding factors for the people in the field of2016 Presidential candidates and the election. Not long after Rubios rider became law, Blue Cross Blue Shield warned (for reasons of self-interest, mainly) that the death spiral would force the government into a single-payer system. Much depends on what comes afterward, and who gets to make those decisions. A Republican Congress wont pass a single-payer system, but a Democratic president wont sign a repeal of ObamaCare. If the collapse begins in October 2016 with United and possibly other insurers parachuting out of the individual marketplaces, then a Republican president would be in good position to sign a repeal and would have a lot more likelihood of getting elected to boot. Otherwise, what might happen is that the system crashes, and nothing follows for several years while the taxes and the mandates still apply. If UnitedHealthCare actually exits the ObamaCare marketplace and the push is on to keep them in the fold thats most of the big boys opting out, and a collapse of the actual insurance aspect of the Affordable Care Act. All because the permanent bail-outs no longer can pull cash from just anywhere in the Health and Human Services budget. This episode in the American lefts century long ill-fated love affair with socialized medicine is not over yet, so, Rubio should hold off on the victory laps, but it was one battle won without anyone noticing until it was too late. He took a page out of the leftist handbook. For THAT, Senator Rubio deserves all the credit in the world. ",3
2,"(PICTURE) Bigfoot Couple Sighted in Pennsylvania John Stoneman and his girlfriend were driving home from a fall festival when they spotted something that has since made them famous. Stoneman believes the two Bigfoot creatures he captured on camera were attracted by the Bigfoot Calling Contest performed at the festival the day before. The couple said they were driving along a main road when Stoneman yelled at his girlfriend to slow down and frantically began snapping pictures of what she could only see as a dark spot in the woods. I said to my girlfriend, youre not going to believe the attention I am going to get from these shots, he related. When asked if he truly believed the creatures to be Bigfoot, Stoneman confessed, Im not trying to fake anything; Im 100% truthful. Im not saying they absolutely are Bigfoot, Im saying I took pictures of dark objects in the woods that I didnt know what they were. Adding that, Im still a skeptic, but I did see something. In answer to critics, Stoneman had this to say: This was not a bear and you can see fur on it. Its wider at the shoulders and tapers down whereas a bear is bigger in the middle and stands differently with its paws out, this was standing like a man, like a Bigfoot. Stoneman undoubtedly has gotten quite a bit of attention from the pictures. So much attention that an anonymous tipper told HuffPost Weird News that the alleged Bigfoot couple is in fact a tree stump, claiming this sightingas just another scam. I thought it was Obama and Moochelle. ",1
2,"[Watch] Brigitte Gabriel, Once a Human Shield Herself - Even Their Own Children are Expendable Brigitte Gabriel experienced firsthand the fear that accompanies being used as a human shield by Palestinians. As a child she and her family were used to protect a mobile rocket launcher which would move from house to house on her street, using the cover that the civilians provided as a defense in their attacks on Israel. She describes the Palestinians as having perfected using children to win the worlds sympathy. She describes one retaliatory strike by Israel in her neighborhood which wounded a woman and her two children. The evening news vilified Israel and showed video of the damage and injuries, with no mention of the provocations. She quotes the Lebanon television as saying Look how horrible the Israelis are, they are killing children. She says that since the Palestinians cannot win militarily against Israel, they use their own children as disposable collateral in order to win the war of public opinion against Israel. Gabriel describes the extensive efforts that the Israelis go to in order to minimize the loss of civilian life and asks why it is that none of the collateral damage and loss of life is attributed to errant Hamas rockets, a large number of which fall upon the civilians of Gaza as well. She says succinctly that Palestinians do not value the lives of their children and that they are willing to sacrifice their children in the cause of jihad.

2,"Michael Browns Mother, Grandmother And Relatives Melee In Street Over T-Shirt Sales From the you cant make this stuff up section of Americana, it seems that all is not peaceful or agreed upon among Michael Browns family. His mother, Leslie McSpadden, has requested that Browns image and memory not be used for self-serving business and profit purposes. Browns grandmother and at least one cousin disagree. From Fox 2 News: It happened Saturday night, October 18th, at about 8:15 pm in the parking lot of Reds BBQ. It`s the corner of Canfield and West Florissant, just blocks from where Michael Brown was shot and killed. Police sources tell us Brown`s Grandmother, Pearlie Gordon, along with Brown`s Cousin Tony Petty, were selling t-shirts and other Michael Brown merchandise. A police report describes a car pulling up and several people getting out. One of those people, was reported to be Michael Brown`s Mom, Lesley McSpadden. A witness described McSpadden yelling You can`t sell this s%$ One of the relatives, who was selling, reportedly demanded McSpadden show a document proving she had a patent. A patentokay, well, whatever documentation Grandmama and the relatives needed, is beside the point. There was a street brawl that evening that resulted in the cousin, Tony Petty, being hit so hard in the face by McSpadden (Browns mother) that he was taken to a local hospital. Then, supposedly McSpadden took off with not just some merchandise and other assorted SWAG, but the cash box. Surrveilance video appearantly picked up the altercation and has not been released yet. Forget the protesters, this is getting good. H/t Gateway Pundit What does my avatar have anything to do with the bile people here are spewing? Who are these crazy bitches????DE and they all got the same name. We Coons is takin overyou know Lawntawndra in Swahilli means bad bitch.. Gots da money now to add some purple highlights to that Lucy hair. Says the complete moron with Haters Gone Hate in his avatar signature! Actually, its their nigger nature. They dont learn anything except how to be more of a nigger in the pavement congo they terrorize and claim ownership over. Weez needs a tripz back to the Africas! (so that America can recover from these heinous pieces of shit) Thats because they ARE animals. Look at the features of a gorilla, and then look at the everyday nigger. They are in the pavement congo instead of the jungle. Thats the only difference. I expected Al Sharpton to roll up with the mother and demand his cut from the money box, too. Niggers cause riots, Evelyn. They have no interest in stopping them. It lets them express their savagery. Duh! Because theyre niggers. Its what they DO. And dont feel bad, because theyre really not humans. They can interbreed, but other than that, theyre animals through and through. Im not religious, but even in your bibles you see stories about niggers being evil and destructive (Caananites). Theyve always been monsters. African isnt a persuasion, its a walking degenerative disease and curse! Thats typical nigger behavior though. Did anyone really expect them to have white or asian class? Blacks (savages) aint got time fo dat. din do nuffin officuh! dey racest cops jus bee pickin on duh black peepholes! Niggers. Cant you read? Youre excused. Niggers. Thank you!!!! Excuse me? Yall sound plain ignorant. That man did not have to kill him!!!!! Police been killing black people since the beginning of time. Our lives matter to. How would yall feel if they were killing white men. People have disagreements thats what family do. The problem is she cant grieve in peace having to deal with shit like this. WURRRR STARRRR !! WURRRR STARRRRR ! SHARKEISHA !! Looks like Thug animal is passed through DNA! The Hood -be- the HOOD! word.. And that is the real question. they must be missin the bling he used to bring home from his job as a thug From the Never Let A Good Tragedy Go To Waste DepartmentMake a buck however you canI wonder if the State and IRS will check this small business and make sure theyre paying state sales taxes and declaring the income theyre making ? The apple doesnt fall far from the tree. The acorn doesnt fall to far from the tree. Did they have permits to sell these was the proper taxes paid so that everything was legal or were they illegally selling shirts and not paying taxes I say that they should be fined and or face the consequences for insiting a riot amongst the people and being a public neusents What cracks me up is that the media tries to pain Brown like some friggin boy scout! The dude was a slime ball banger Apple didnt fall far from that tree, I see These Kneegrows never cease to amaze. Apple doesnt fall far from the tree If this had been the Sarah Palin family it would have had the first 10 minutes on the evening news with Brainless Williams. How many surnames are in this family? None of them have the same last name. Start there. TRIBE OF THIEVES I wonder if Thuggery is genetic?? Why would she grab the money box and run off with it if shes not interested in profiting from this? This is sad!! I feel for the loss of A human being without a doubt that is sad!! BUT it looks like all the evidence is pointing to the kid being at fault. from the video of him robbing a store,to all the forensic evidence,I think the cop was justified.. but what I dont understand is why certain people of the African persuasion have to riot loot,break in stores,destroy things, cause damage,make death threats if they dont get what they want.. What ever happened to thee due process of law before all the evidence and everything is even out there right away user looting destroying robbing stores making death threats going crazy automatically assuming just because hes black he was killed because of race what do you think the rest of the world thinks? Do you see any other race doing the things that you do? EXACTLY TO SAY THE LEASTTHEY SHOULD ALL BE PUT DOWN How funny would it be if people looted the t-shirts while the family riot was going on! Will they accept EBT at the t-shirt table? Let me guessthe COPS were bought in to break it up? I know its wrong, but this is Sadly Entertaining. Like a Car wreck, dont want to look but the FORCE is STRONG in this DISASTER Sad sad sad but not surprising at a time when a family should be grieving and honoring the memory of a loved one they are rolling around in the street fighting over who gits to sell T-shirts ! Dear ol mom is most likely mad cause granny beat her to the punch makin a dollar off of her son ! The people of Ferguson and St. Louis should not waste another minute of time or effort on these thugs ! But unfortunately once the verdict clearing officer Wilson is read there will be rioting in the streets like nobodies business I hope I am wrong but sadly most likely not . The thug didnt fall far from the tree, did it? Mike Browns mom: YOU CANT SELL THAT !!!! . but, on second thought, Ill take the cash. Well this pretty much cinches the case. The Brown family are just violent thugs. It should be very simple now to have Ofc. Wilson completely exonerated from any wrongdoing whatsoever. in the meantime, on what day and time will she be turning over the gross receipts from the T-Shirt sales to pay for some of the things that were looted in her babys name ? And how much is Darren Wilsons cut. After all, her son would never be famous if it werent for the good works of Ofc. Wilson! He was such a good boy w/good role models surrounding him. We now know what is going to take Honey Boo Boos place! They should at least do a Thanksgiving special! Get them all in one room with food and forks and knives. Sweet! Phucking animals Sience beez raysis. Brown was killed, and his skin was black. Therefore, Brown = victim. Thanks a lot, Nancy Grace. You ugly stupid b1tch. Lol subhuman savage beasts This story says it all. Trayvon and Brown got what they deserved. The good old ventilation treatment to cure the over groid-ance of their areas of town. gentle giant my a$$. More to come, brought to you by rap music and malt liquor. SHOWS THE NUT DIDNT FALL FAR FROM THE TREE, I WOULD LAUGH IF THE MOTHER GETS ARRESTED FOR THUG ROBBERY,GUESS THATS WHERE HER KID LEARNED IT FROM, I HOPE SHE RESIST ARREST, THAT WOULD BE SO COOL.BITCH. wtf What are people thinking these days. Rioters are just trying to get their names in the papers and if the media does it they are crazy. PLANET OF THE APES You hit the nail on the head there. The are a bunch of ignorant thugs living off of our tax dollars No the one word is niggers. Looks like they are filming Hood Life Volume 4 in Ferguson. Umwhy are people saying she is the one selling stuff. Did anyone read the article. The other relatives and grandma are doing it. She told them no and got upset when they wouldnt stop. Geeshread. It is sad that this young man is dead even if it is justified. What these people are doing in Ferguson isnt justice for Mike Brown it is for total disrespect for authority , how is destroying and doing all this crap respecting the dead, it isnt. This is just an act of people that feel sorry for themselves because they are black and cant succeed in life. Well guess what there are plenty of succesful black people, what they did was get out of bed, put the weed down and worked,,, yes thats right worked, these people in Ferguson are destroying there own community, i say quit showing them attention and let the animals play!!! LOL! Good One! LOL Niggers acting like niggers, who would have thought? The whole family in nothing but thugs. Like mother, like son. Welcome to the jungle! What a bunch of uneducated hoodrats! But the baby boy was an angel. Ha! Apple didnt fall far from the tree. The whole family has a rap sheet, Im sure. Mikey didnt even live with the mother, if you can even call her that. She has some other man. His father, I mean sperm donor, lives with some other woman. Punk lived with Granny, who was also involved in the altercation last Sat. They are just looking for a payday off their dead thug sons death. Her boy took after Mom, Sh*ts getting old! Uuuuhhhhh The APEple Needs to be sent back to the trees. The mother had the right to sell or not to sell. Without her permission, they should have never sold a thing. You can dress them better, give them words to say, but at the end of the day these people are just trashy ghetto slime. They have spent their whole lives fighting and breeding, all the perfume in the world will not cover the stink of entitlement on this family. Thug see, thug do What a F-ing jokeso distraught over their baby boys death that they have to sell t-shirts? And then fight over selling them????? Wow. The racially charged comments here are sickening. ANIMALS! Wild sheboons fighting and tearing off weaves as usual. DEY DIN DO NUFFIN !! WURRRR STARRRRR !!! WURRRR STARRRRR !! Hey, theres money to be made Just send in the National Guard and start blasting away if they refuse to settle down. They are breaking the law and that is a fact! They need to PAY for their lawlessness. America needs to know that we are all safe from would-be lunatics like them! THIS is where the term, SO GHETTO comes from! Around blacks, never relax. Do you not have spellcheck, or double check your writing? Surrveilance video appearantly picked up the altercation and has not been released yet. Really? Ill take BOYZ in da HOOD, for 100, Alex! Who gets a patent on their dead sons name??? Sick. Who exactly wants to be a fat black bully? Maybe they need rent, or some gin and juice. Self-explanatory activities in Niggville. It is ALWAYS about the money and who gets it. if Oblama had a son. I wonder if you have to show you are smoking weed and willing to assault an armed police officer in order to wear one of those I AM MICHAEL BROWN T-Shirts? PANTS UP! DONT LOOT! Holy shit, you do nt have a fucking CLUE what a patent is. Also, cool off in the number of ads in your shitty shite. Dumb fuck. And the award for Best Comment goes to ^^^^ Wees cant be following no white mens laws, wees be angry cuz da white mens laws!!! Similar to the Duncan family looking to cash in on the EBOLA death. Typical, looking for a lottery win off of a tragedy those are our nations laws and if you dont like them you are free to leave the USA and go where ever you want.We are a nation of laws for everyone and those laws do not have a color typical black culture values violence in the home, violence in the streets, violence on others private property, violence on government property, violence perpetrated on whites, violence aired on TV. Some wonder if Jim Crow was on to something??? These people truly do not understand Christian values, do not understand civil behavior This black culture of rage is even beliw the rage and hatred of Muslims No wonder so many black felons while in jail join the Black Muslim Brotherhood The values of both cultures encourages violence on family and all through society that these cultures reject. Its far from dead the rioters will never accept the evidence and will riot some more and then we will see some blood shed and it might really turn out nasty.I hope Im wrong,we can do nothing more than wait and see Greed! I still say the officer should file a lawsuit for slander and defamation of character. The family is making money off of implying that he murdered someone. That cash box that Browns mother took should go (at least partly) to Officer Wilson. And they wonder why their precious innocent thug got himself killed. Learned his behavior at home apparently. What mother? You mean the woman whoop have birth to him? The experiences Ive had with the nogs that run around my neighborhood is that their mothers allow them to run wild until God forbid you ask them not to call your eight year old daughter a fing Bitch then they wanna fight like a animals. THIS MOTHER FUCKER COULD NOT LEAD MY ASS TOO WATER WE BETTER WAKE UP MIDDLE OF NOVEMBER WE ARE GOING TO BE FUCKED THIS COUNTRY IS GOING TO GROW BY MILLIONS TALKING ABOUT RAPING THE CONSTITUTION JUST WAIT unfortunately I wish I could agree as far as the story being dead here we are discussing what is going in the media so its alive and strong, its on the news every morning. The cop was doing his job PERIOD, there are things about his youth and being charged for murder at the age of 15 but hey that sealed that fast which is against the law. But they are doing as they please. My thoughts exactly!! A patent!?! LOL What a bunch of morons. Proves what kinda people they really are! Huh ! oh they already have all the evidence, its been processed, they found Browns blood and one finger print on the interior of the police car, from the way the bullets entered and exited his body, he was not 10 feet away with his arms raised, nor was he running away, the holes have gun shot residue and stippling burns around the bullet holes, and even a shot to the top of his head because he was leaning over into the car reaching for the cops gun, proof is there, I think they are waiting till after the elections to give out the news, though with how the media is, there is no story for them to feast over anymore, they cant call the cop a racist killer because the media knows about the proof of evidence, thats why the story is pretty much dead now in the media They seem like lovely people. I hope they keep breeding. God Bless America. Is that a Buick Grand National in the background? All these relatives and nobody has the same last name! Looks like the Ferguson police may yet be able to prosecute a family member for assault and robbery Blacks will be Blacks in da Hood! Wow.justwow. Hmmmm, why would I want to be Mike Brown? He is dead and well deserved! What law abiding citizen goes for a police officers gun? These idiots prove that the apple doesnt fall far from the tree. Stupid is as stupid does. I feelnothing for these people Hilarious. I hope someone filmed it. They are just following their mentor, Sabrina Fulton, Traygones mother. Trayvons Foundation is raking in the money for Jackson and Sharpton. CANT WAIT TO SEE THAT VIDEO ON WORLD STAR HIPHOP Itll fit right in with the rest of the hood-rat fights This is hilarious, this thugs family are rioting over who gets the money from his t-shirt sales, wow! What class,this is probably the first and only legal dollar the thug ever provided for this family and they are beating each other up like a bunch of crows fighting over road kill. violence,greed,thieft and lies and thats MBs family.Im still trying to figure out why grandma didnt stop and pick him up when she saw him walking down the middle of the street. Boy I thought my family was dysfunctional EXACTLY!!!!! As she stood there and stated she didnt want to make money off her Gentle Giant my ASS but I have to say she has a good right hook LMAO!!!! Everything comes out in the wash it will all come out not through the media but a average sleuth looking for info will let us know!!! Its already not looking good for the fool. If they all had job and not live off welfare they would need sleep for the next day, but nope let that POS gives them their entitlements and has his thugs go down there and take care of business, ha slap you POS in your flippin face. SO DONE!!!!! Just proves low class GHETTO Family with a smig of VIOLENCE, the same act that got her son killed by a police officer, she administered to her NEPHEW. Classy really classy!!!! This is getting old. If the mother would have raised him difference he might be here today.You can clearly see, how there acting, he was not taught any thing but causing trouble.Now there starting a tee shirt sale, like he is running for office or something lauuuggghhhh my asss off. To be continued on Jerry Springer. What ? ! not to cheat,steal or lie ? How do you think the pResident attained that office ? Mike Browns family taught him to be a thug just like them, to bad Obama is to busy raping the Constitution to stand up and act a leader to the country and teach people to respect and help one another rather than steal, cheat and lie! THOSE ARE white man laws! I dont really blame her for not wanting her dead sons name and/or image exploited for profit. Seems to me, though, that she might want to get active in stopping the riots and b.s. going on in his name. Race baiting is a money making business. What do you expect.. monkey mentallity Arrest them for selling without a license. Thats justice!!!!! Hmmmmm. looks like the apple doesnt fall far from the tree now does it Needs a bullseye circle. IF SHE ACTS LIKE THAT, NO ONE CAN TELL ME BABY BOY WAS A GENTLE GIANT. You can take em out of the jungle, but..

That is the method of access which was determined to have been exploited by those responsible for carrying out the terrorist attacks of 9/11, 2001. The Obama regime is deliberately dismantling our security and flooding this country with foreigners of every description, many of which have intentions of doing us harm. They are not simply stupid, they are treacherous. The report highlights how one of the top recommendation of the 9/11 commission was to revamp and clean up the student visa system. In spite of that urgent warning, nothing has been done. Senator Jeff Sessions describes that failing as a matter of national security. DHS, the agency supposedly responsible for safeguarding our nation, is actively involved, through the Obama operative Jeh Johnson, in gutting our security protections and leaving us vulnerable to attack from a variety of sources. ICE issued a pathetic defense of the indefensible, saying, Any insinuation that ICE is not actively investigating visa overstay cases with links to potential links to national security and public safety is false. The agency has made numerous improvements to visa security since 9/11. Their defensive argument is false. Investigating cases is much different from protection and enforcement. DHS and ICE leadership has together created a situation where enforcement is a thing of the past and only those identified as possible terrorists receive scrutiny. All other illegal aliens who have managed to escape the potential link to national security label are free to roam about as they choose. Its much the same line of thought as Hussein Obama holding meetings on ISIS for months with his national security advisors and describing that process as having a strategy. The system is a joke, as is our Department of Homeland Security under this regime. The schools, which in addition to universities, include institutions instructing in beauty, massage, hair-braiding, tennis, golf and shoeing horses, are responsible for student oversight and reporting. The State Department is completely outside the loop, as are DHS and ICE. The report cites numerous examples of schools not doing the governments job of policing the visa program. Homeland Security and ICE seem content to play catch-up after the fact. Megyn Kelly points out that Obama has been telling us in recent days that there is no immediate threat to the homeland. She quotes from a joint op-ed posted by Obama and UK Prime Minister David Cameron in which they take a shot at their critics, saying, First, those who want to adopt an isolationist approach misunderstand the nature of security in the 21st century. Within the same document, they contradict themselves to a degree, saying, Developments in other parts of the world, particularly in Iraq and Syria, threaten our security at home. Kelly says, Congressman, my head is going to explode, which is it? They are a threat to the homeland or they are not? Congressman King says they are a real threat and enumerates the different reasons why and the different varieties of terrorists. The dismissive tone of Obamas comments, that this community organizer turned leader somehow understands security or any other issue better than the American people is absurd. Hes in over his head, he cant handle the job, and we, the American people are going to be the ones who pay the price for his ineptitude and the ignorance of our fellow Americans who bought his line of bolognatwice.

2,"[Watch] John McCain Say Malaysia Airliner Has Earmarks of Tragic Mistake - Really? The earmarks of a tragic mistake are an interesting concept. He indicates he has determined from the limited evidence presently available that the missile which brought down the Malaysian Airliner over Ukraine was accidentally fired, a mistake. That is suspicious language from the war-monger McCain, that he would label something a mistake in the first place and secondly with very limited information upon which to base his determination. Of course, it would be in keeping with and a boost to McCains drive to arm the Ukrainians if he were able to blame the Russians. That fact alone calls into question his comments as well as there being no possible upside for the Russians to the downing of a civilian airliner. Were the Ukrainians able to down an airliner and successfully pin the responsibility on the Russians, they would be able to make a much more credible argument in favor of the world providing them with lethal weapons and aid. That is the only motive that seems logical at this point. McCains comments could be seen as having the earmarks of someone who wants to set the narrative that his opponents are guilty before all of the evidence has even been collected. This is a serious matter and their is no reason or benefit to the United States in jumping to premature conclusions. One things is certain, there is more to this than first meets the eye.

2,"Flower-Power Christians Ask Obama To Give Peace A Chance In The Middle East Now that all sorts of pacifist and non-violent minded people have called on the world to eliminate and neutralize the terrorist threat known to the world as ISIS or ISIL or IS depending on who is doing the talking, 53 national religious groups are petitioning Barack Obama and the Regime to help the civilians in Iraq, but not use any kind of military force against the aggressors. What, do these flower people think that the young, passionate, bloodthirsty jihadis are going to see all the love and goodness flowing to the infidel and just surrender? The terrorists are going out of their way to behead Christians just for being Christians. What exactly IS in those brownies the aging hippies are serving? Much to the embarrassment of many of the Faithful, the petition letter appeared on the website of the Maryknolls, a Catholic order that left the catechesis reservation some time ago and is working its way into extinction. (All the still liberal orders are.) Unfortunately, several of the co-signers are from other orders also working their way into extinction. And what do the stuck in the 60s sorts have to say? As religious communities, leaders, and academics, we write to express our deep concern over the recent escalation of U.S. military action in Iraq. While the dire plight of Iraqi civilians should compel the international community to respond in some way, U.S. military action is not the answer. Lethal weapons and airstrikes will not remove the threat to a just peace in Iraq. Maybe not, but lethal weapons and airstrikes will destroy the aggressors stolen lethal weapons which can be used against the innocent civilians thus increasing the likelihood that peace might be achieved once the dust settles. As difficult as it might be, in the face of this great challenge, we believe that the way to address the crisis is through long-term investments in supporting inclusive governance and diplomacy, nonviolent resistance, sustainable development, and community-level peace and reconciliation processes. Theyre kidding, right? ISIS jihadis are more likely to shoot those preaching peaceful overtures just to get them out of the way of a tank column. Pope Francis has affirmed that peacemaking is more courageous than warfare, and more recently said that it is licit to stop the unjust aggressor. I underscore the verb stop; I dont say bomb, make war stop him. But how, we ask? Yes, but when the enemy is determined to destroy YOU, and has zero mercy or tolerance, which are key necessities to a lasting peace, without divine intervention, there has to be some kind of clash. For historical perspective, please review the defensive nature of the Crusades. Theres some more nonsense that demonstrates why religious leaders are not the best arbiters of foreign policy and military action. And then the good and peaceful Christians throw all Just War Theology out the window and provide a step by step plan on how to give peace a chance: Stop U.S. bombing in Iraq to prevent bloodshed, instability and the accumulation of grievances that contribute to the global justification for the Islamic States existence among its supporters. And who is going to destroy all the American military equipment the bloodthirsty terrorists stole with which they are shedding blood and destablizing what is left of Iraq? At this point, grievances are off the table. Provide robust humanitarian assistance to those who are fleeing the violence. Provide food and much needed supplies in coordination with the United Nations. Or asylum somewhere. Seriously, why does everyone call on the United Nations in international crises? In order to get any sort of humanitarian assistance into the Iraqi mountains, its going to take a military convoy. And whos military will be used? The United States. So why not cut out the middle man? Engage with the UN, all Iraqi political and religious leaders, and others in the international community on diplomatic efforts for a lasting political solution for Iraq. Ensure a significantly more inclusive Iraqi government along with substantive programs of social reconciliation to interrupt the flow and perhaps peel-back some of the persons joining the Islamic State. In the diplomatic strategy, particularly include those with influence on key actors in the Islamic State. This particular enemy isnt interested. The ISIS terrorists overran cities and made the bloodshed look glorious to young, impassioned believers just like the dreamers of the 60s were when they revolted against the established social order. Work for a political settlement to the crisis in Syria. The conflicts in Iraq and Syria are intricately connected and should be addressed holistically. Return to the Geneva peace process for a negotiated settlement to the civil war in Syria and expand the agenda to include regional peace and stability. Ensure Irans full participation in the process. Ensure IRANs full participationseriously, what is in those brownies? Yall do know that there is no such thing as freedom in Iran, right? Theres Iranian women who post pictures of themselves on the internet in remote locations of that country after taking off their headscarves. Beautiful women who call it Stealthy Freedom because thats what it is. They cant go bareheaded in Iranian the cities without being arrested for violating Sharia law. And the Geneva Convention? Thats followed by civilized peoples. The ISIS-IS-ISIL members and recruits cut off peoples heads. That is not civilized. No convention or international treaty is going to stop them. Only brute force will. Theres more in the letter that is an insult to anyone with any clue of what has been going on in the Middle East for the last hundred years. No use rehashing it. In the meantime, while prayer and appeals to a higher power should always be a part of not simply a peaceful resolution to conflict, but defeat of evil, recognition that there is such a thing as justified force must also be a factor. The Caliphate of the Islamic State fighters will not be halted with peaceful overtures and a plan for regional cooperation. They want complete control of the former Islamic lands and are willing to die for the cause. Are the flower-power Christians willing to put their lives on the line to try to talk them out of it? ",3
2,"Bernie Backer Threaten Chaos as Convention Kicks-off Ask any Democrat in Washington, Walls dont work, maybe not but it is probably a good thing that they put up an 8 feet high fence that stretches four miles long around their convention. Because at last count there were some 20,000 very upset Sanders Supporters that were planning on raising Hell at their convention this week. Already the dingy head of the DNC, Debbie Wasserman-Schultz, has submitted her resignation over the most recent flap contained in hacked emails, and Wiki-leaks has promised more to come that show a concerted effort on the part of the establishment to freeze out Sanders from the nomination. In fact in a statement over the weekend, the Wiki-leaks founder said that we havent seen anything yet and promised more emails that would sink Hillary Clintons chances for election in November. All this came as the Democrats begin Day One of their convention Monday still facing the potential for rowdy protests from Bernie Sanders delegates and supporters. Sanders supporters were angry over leaked emails that show the Florida congresswoman and her team blasting Sanders and discussing ways to undermine him, and have promised protests and demonstration aimed at disrupting the convention. While Debbies resignation could calm that storm, the liberal wing still appears intent on protesting over other grievances including Clinton, the partys presumptive presidential nominee, picking Sen. Tim Kaine of Virginia as her running mate. Norman Solomon, a Sanders delegate from California, said Sunday that Clinton picking acentrist like Kaine is an assault on the progressive agenda. He said the roughly 1,250 Sanders delegates connected to his Bernie Delegates Network are considering walking out during the Virginia senators expected acceptance speech at the Wells Fargo Center, and they are even looking into contesting his nomination. Clearly things are not as wonderful in the liberal party as the news media would have you believe. Solomon said their response reflects anger and disappointment over Clinton and like-minded Washington Democrats control over the party. We dont know exactly what to expect on the convention floor, Solomon also said. The uncertainty and rancor on several fronts puts the Democrats in a similar position as the Republicans when they entered their convention a week ago looking to soothe tensions between their presidential nominee and those who backed her primary rivals. But frankly, the clashes on the Democratic side have already outmatched last weeks fireworks in Cleveland, with Wasserman Schultz resignation standing as a stunning development on convention eve. The political spectacle already has distracted from the historic convention where Clinton is set to become the first female presidential nominee of a major party. As a result of the scandal, Wasserman Schultz has been largely sidelined from the convention though she will open and close it Sanders is set to speak Monday. In a written statement, he praised the DNC chairwoman for stepping down. Debbie Wasserman Schultz has made the right decision for the future of the Democratic Party. While she deserves thanks for her years of service, the party now needs new leadership that will open the doors of the party and welcome in working peopleand young people. The party leadership must also always remain impartial in the presidential nominating process, something which did not occur in the 2016 race, he said. The resignation comes after WikiLeaks on Thursday released roughly 20,000 DNC emails, with more revelations emerging Sunday about Wasserman Schultz criticizing the Vermont senator to staffers. He isnt going to be president, she wrote in one May 21 email, also saying that Sanders vowing at the time to replace her as chairwoman was a silly story. But I guess it was not so silly based on the weekends events. In a major effort at damage control, Clinton chief strategist Joel Benenson, on Sunday attempted to defend the fairness of the primary elections and said the DNC would conduct a full review of the emails. He said people should not jump to conclusions. After all, you should never believe what you see with your own eyes if youre a Democrat and always wait for the party leadership to tell you what to believe and to say because youre all idiots and incapable of making up your own minds. The DNCs impact in these things is minimal compared to the results. What candidates and campaigns spend and do on the ground, talking to voters day in and day out, thats what determines who wins, he said. Not to mention the Super Delegates that vote exactly the way that party officials tell them too. After all, Bernie had a 1200 delegate shortfall before the first vote was cast. Solomon suggested Sunday that the Sanders delegates frustration goes beyond the Kaine pick to include convention rules, climate change and the party platform, which they think fails to include enough of Sanders hard-fought progressive agenda. Starting on Sunday, the convention saw several large protests that took place near City Hall, in nearly 100-degree temperatures and under the watchful eye of city police officers. A lot of Democratic supporters labeled Bernie Sanders supporters conspiracy theorists. The WikiLeaks confirms what we thought all along, said Perry Mitchell, a 32-year-old Maryland who came to Philadelphia to participate in protests. Many of the early protests focus on concerns about clean energy. You see both parties are controlled by the oil and gas industry; those are the big donors, said Wendy Brawer a protester from New York City. But in a movement, you still have to do something to create change. Changing your lifestyle means youre part of the solution. People have to use less. It remains to be seen how the rest of the week plays out, but Mrs. Clinton is smack in the middle of the biggest scandal to hit her since Bill Clinton got caught lying to both congress and the American people about not having sex with Monica Lewinsky. But hey, as the presumptive nominee would probably say, at this point what does it matter? Fox News and the Associated Press contributed to this story. ",4
2,"War on Drugs: Senate Looking Into Reducing Prison Population Its one of the consequences of the war on drugs, the people of the Obama Justice Department and the ACLU tell the world. Prison overcrowding in the United States. All of those mandatory sentencing laws passed back in the 1980s and since have culminated into a whole lot of non-violent felons loitering in the halls of maximum security facilities, and that is making living conditions less than desirable. This problem has been pervasive for enough years that the United States federal government now spends a full quarter of the Justice Departments budget on maintaining federal prisons. Before the 2015 summer break, senators from both sides of the aisle were negotiating a deal to be sure that those who are arrested and convicted of drug offenses do serve some time, but will be given a legitimate shot at time off for good behavior. From the Daily Signal: They want to announce a deal as soon as they get back, but they just arent quite there yet, says Conn Carroll, the communications director for Sen. Mike Lee, a committee member and leading reform advocate. Lets just say its first and goal on the one, everyone thinks well score, we just dont know when, Carroll continued. The judiciary committees compromise bill is not expected to include reductions to mandatory minimums that are blamed for mass incarceration. Mandatory minimums require binding prison terms of a particular length and prevent judges from using their discretion to apply punishment. But the legislation is expected to give judges some leeway in sentencing drug offenders. All the cute football metaphors aside, it seems that the big bone of contention is the number of first-time, non-violent offenders serving incredibly long sentences which has been blamed on not having access to lawyers other than public defenders. Most reports on the prison overcrowding issue indicate that offenders arrested in the the suburbs have the money to be able to afford better lawyers. Of late, that had prompted the well to do Koch brothers to join the ACLU in lobbying Congress to address the problem. We think the criminal justice system needs reforms in a comprehensive way, says Mark Holden, general counsel and senior vice president at Koch Industries. Holden isthe right-hand man of conservative billionaires Charles and David Koch on the brothers push for criminal justice reform. The way the system is set up now, it is not working the way it should, Holden continued. You have a two-tiered system where if you are rich and well-connected, you end up OK. If you are poor, you wont. We are wanting to remove these obstacles. If you believe in the Bill of Rights, and against infringement of our rights, this is the place we need to be. Be that as it may, the truth is that the drug culture is destructive across the entirety of society. The question that needs to be answered for drug offenders who are on the list for time off with good behavior is have they learned their lesson? The Senate Judiciary committee headed by Senator Chuck Grassley (R-IA) is expected to produce a bill that takes pieces and parts from proposed legislation of the recent past and cobble together some sort of compromise between the live and let live crowd, and those who believe that fear of long prison terms is a deterrent to crime. Seriously though, unless parole and prevention is part of the package, its going to be just like everything else when the criminals are let back into society. A mess. ",3
2,"Feds Hit Mafia HARD! Dozens of Arrest Made in 5 States! In an early morning raid Federal authorities arrested more than 40 alleged Mafia members that stretch across five states. The charges are for racketeering, extortion, loan sharking, smuggling, arson, and gun trafficking. The 46 defendants tie into five major Mafia families: the Genovese, Gambino, Luchese, and Bonanno families. Some accused mobsters belong to to the main Philadelphia family, according to a federal indictment that was unsealed in New York. According to Business Insider: Law enforcement agents swept up more than 40 defendants in New York, New Jersey, Connecticut, Massachusetts and Florida, an FBI spokeswoman said. In a second indictment unsealed in Massachusetts on Thursday, two of the defendants were accused of working for the Genovese family and charged in a separate extortion scheme, along with three other members of the family. The New York defendants, with nicknames such as Rooster, Tony the Cripple and Mustache Pat, used violence, threats and the destruction of property to intimidate their neighborhoods, according to authorities. In one instance, several defendants attacked an individual they believed was panhandling outside a restaurant owned by one of the mobsters, using glass jars and steel-tipped boots, prosecutors said. In another incident, some defendants set fire to a car parked outside a rival gambling club. The various schemes extended from New York to Costa Rica, including running sports gambling rings, selling untaxed cigarettes and making fake credit cards, the indictment said.

2,"EPA Chief McCarthy Denies Environmental Lobbyists Participated in Crafting Regulations A New York Timesarticle, exposed that the land use and energy obstructionist lobbying group Natural Resources Defense Council basically authoredthe EPAs latest power plant regulations. That agenda-damaging revelationis now being denied by EPA chief Gina McCarthy. The revelation was made in a July 6tharticle, which asserted that the group had produced areportwhich was the blueprint for the regulations. McCarthy said the article, written by an experienced environmental reporter, Coral Davenport, was given surprising credibility. McCarthy characterized the assertion in testimony before lawmakers on Wednesday, saying, Its a discredit to [EPA employees] to suggest that this was designed by one group months ago. This is a result of hard work. That is not the same thing as saying it is not true, McCarthy herself and their agency could be considered a discredit to the original intentions of the agency. She offers the number of meetings rather than the substance of the report as evidence in attempting to refute the claims, saying, I have met many more times with utilities than I have with NRDC. One meeting in which she is handed a report to review would have been sufficient. She could have even completely avoided meeting with them and had one of her underlings deliver the report, but that would have made denying their influence even more suspicious. Republicans who have their eyes open to the EPAs shady dealings didnt accept her claims and responded with criticism of the agency for catering to wealthy liberal elites at the expense of ordinary Americans. Senator John Barrasso (R-WY) said during the hearings, It is absolutely shameful to me that the EPA under the direction here of the Administrator, will allow this powerful group of lawyers and lobbyists to draft their regulations but yet this same Administrator refuses to actually listen to the people whose lives and jobs will be severely impacted by these regulations drawn up by wealthy lawyers and lobbyists. He continued, Lets be clear, the NRDC is a wealthy, elite, powerful lobbying machine with more influence over decision making in Washington than an ordinary American citizen. They have millions, which gives them access. The EPA has turned a deaf ear on those who dont. Davenports article exposed how a group which included both NRDC lobbyists and their select team of experts authored a 110-page coal-killing proposal which was adopted in virtual totality by the EPA in June of this year. Davenport also exposed how the NRDC was lobbying on behalf of their newly drafted guidelines prior to their adoption, in what would be consistent with acting on behalf of the EPA or under the belief that their recommendations were going to be adopted. It is no secret that the EPA is demonstrating a pattern of power consolidation measures and regulatory restrictions which will place it into the position of control over every aspect of American life. This will have a devastating impact of our foundation of liberty. If this is allowed to continue, the freedom and rights guaranteed in the U.S. Constitution will be subject to EPA approval. Our economic viability as well as the ability to heat and cool our homes and our freedom of mobility will be soon require McCarthys demonic blessing. The EPA makes claims to expand their power contingent upon a denial by Congress. Each time that denial does not take place, by a minimum of a fifty percent majority in each house, the EPA and Obama have succeeded in further degrading the freedom of the American people. The fact that the socialist McCarthy cant believe Republicans would object to that is further demonstration of the serious nature of the threat posed by the EPA and their push to incorporate UN Agenda 21 compliance into their regulations.

2,"NFL Ratings Funk: America Speaks, Whole League Blaming Wrong Issue Whoever is running the National Football League and the affiliated sports reporting and programming needs to get in the now. After four straight weeks of what is described as alarming ratings drops of Americas top sports property, at least one sports outlet, Sports Business Daily, is somewhat recognizing that maybe politics is playing a role. See, back in 2000, during the Bush vs. Gore debacle, there was a similar drop in viewership. Not the double digit drops the NFL is seeing this season, but there was a significant drop across the board. Its not just the NFL. The Summer Olympics on NBC were down double digits in viewership from the London Games. ESPNs Sunday Night Baseball posted its lowest viewership average in at least a decade. Six NASCAR races from Aug. 21 to Sept. 25 logged double-digit viewership drops in race-to-race comparisons. Four prime-time UFC telecasts on Fox registered a combined 10 percent viewership drop this year. Could the answer be politics and a hotly contested presidential race that is eating up a lot of Americans free time? Maybe. But it could also be that in American culture, sports is meant as an escape from the world of politics. In the last few decades, politics has more than crept into sports. Based on the comments that people who care enough to leave on public commenting boards, that is a huge factor. And when it comes to the NFL, the league that seems to care more about profits than absolutely anything else, stomping on the fans love of country and their sacrifices for the security of the players on the field has left a very bad taste in a lot of peoples mouths. Hence, millions of people have found other things to do while the games are being played. (This writers father included. The man has not watched one minute of the NFL this season. Never thought it would ever happen.) Sunday Night Football, televisions highest-rated prime-time show for five years running, has seen a 10 percent viewership drop so far this season. Cables top sports property, Monday Night Football, is down 19 percent the series slowest start in a decade. Through two games, Thursday Night Football viewership is down 15 percent. There are some things that are acknowledged: there is more live streaming going on; many people no longer have cable, and head to another venue to watch; and, to an extent, the games are getting boring for one reason or another. (Lack of star quarterbacks is blamed by several people. Really?) Wellmaybe, but probably not. In the last three weeks, we out on the fruited plain who wont watch the National Felons League for one reason or another have exercised quite a bit of schadenfreude. Watching the people express their opinions the only way we really can not watching or attending games and in turn listening to the excuses from not just the league, but the sports writers has been fascinating. Just like the people in Washington, they are massively out of sync with the fan base. Yeah, with all the diluting of the talent base thats gone on with expansion, some sports have gotten boring. (Hockey, on the other hand, got better with the Europeans coming over to play here.) But what theyve really gotten to be is another way for individuals with a microphone to open their mouths about politics. Thats not why fans tune into sports, and pro football in particular. When the NFL high brass and sports writers figure that out, come and talk to us. Until then, We the People encourage Proctor and Gamble to pull Tide advertising from the NFL. Thats one product several of us would like to not have to boycott. ",1

2,"Second Amendment, Baby: One Nation Importing Americas Gun Culture It looks like more people out there than just Americanconservatives have noticed that guncontrol laws just dont work. In fact, one of our neighbors to the south not only noticed but have decided to adopt our ideal that an armed society is a polite one. From the OrangeCounty Register: pro-Second Amendment arguments are familiar to us here in the United States, but the more guns, less crime experience of the U.S. is being trumpeted in a somewhat unlikely place: Panama. The Central American nation has been struggling with rising crime, gang activity and forged gun permits. In order to address these problems, and promote personal safety, the government is preparing to lift its ban on firearms imports, in place since 2012, so that citizens may better defend themselves. Everything seems to indicate that there is no direct correlation in the aphorism that says more guns mean more crime, said Mr. Aguilera, who cited the 20-year decline in the homicide rate in the U.S. as gun laws have simultaneously been relaxed. Other than in the few bigcities where guncontrol laws are REALLY strict to be honest. In those places the homicide rate is off thecharts bad. In the states whereconcealedcarry is a way of lifehomicide drops to near the bottom world-wide. Panama adopting a gunculture insofar as they will allow their people to keep and bear arms for protection, is but one nation bucking an international movement that starts with the United Nations trying to assert supremacy over the entire world. It is not acharging movement, but it is a start, and should be applauded. By definition,criminals are willing to break the law. Guncontrol will not stop that. But weapons in the hands of thecitizens will keep the people from being sitting ducks for the people whoconsidercrime a way of life. ",3
2,"Hacked Ashley Madison Data Strips Female Profiles...The Ugly Truth Behind All That Gloss Uh, oh. All those millions of men looking to have affairs, Im afraid theres some more embarrassing and bad news. Now that the Ashley Madison hack data dump is putting names with profiles, wrecking marriages and reputations, and prompting some disgraced former pillars of the community to confess or commit suicide, the most ironic twist comes out. Most of the profiles of women on the site are pure memorex. From the Washington Post: Ashley Madison has long claimed, in triumphant news releases and slick, Web-ready graphics, that it is one of the few dating sites that really clicks with women. According to statistics CEO NoelBiderman has trumpeted in the media, Ashley Madison enjoys an overall 70/30 gender split with a 1:1 male/female ratio among the under-30 set. But the user records laid bare by hackers last week tell a very different story: Of the more than 35 million records released, only 5 million a mere 15 percent actually belonged to women. So, thats 30 million men looking to cheat, with 5 million women to share between them, most of whom might well be prostitutes, if the entity responsible for the hack is to be believed. Theres a certain amount of poetic justice in that, but the reality is that Ashley Madison, just like a whole lot of other dating sites out there (except Ave Maria Singles where the men:women ratio is reversed, and the guys are looking for the Virgin Mary in a 22-year old models body living less than a hundred miles away), fakes womens profiles just to lure men to spend money on the site. Ya dont say. Well, as it turns out, this is not news to the insiders of the dating site industry. Or anyone who has used the sites and has had a miserable experience, truth be told. What sells the service is the promise of happily ever after or no strings attached sex in the case of Ashley Madison. However, the reality is that female user profiles, many times, are manufactured like fishing lures. Ashley Madison has paid people to write profiles, and theyve allowed fake profiles to proliferate on their site, said David Evans, an industry consultant who has contracted with Ashley Madison in the past and has tracked the business of online dating since 2002. Tons of sites are guilty of that. Thats not news. Adult dating and hook-up sites have a serious problem, though, [Ryan Pitcher, who spent two years running afake-profile team for Global Personals] says: While they have no problem attracting interested guys, they absolutely bomb when it comes to women. Some of that has to do with openly misogynist marketing; some of it relates to womens well-conditioned social and sexual roles; much of it has to do with the fact that being a rare woman on a site full of desperate, oversexed, uninhibited dudes is objectively terrible. Whatever the exact cause, on the adult sites Pitcher worked on, real women accounted for less than 2 percent of total profiles. And so he and a 28-person team, working in Global Personals vaguely named admin department, spent their work hours crafting very sexy, very fictional profiles and messaging users from them. Profile-writers made roughly $25,000 a year, with bonuses for hitting certain monthly subscription targets. $25,000 a year to have email and chat conversations with men who are looking for female companionshipmaybe its time to bring back the ice cream social and bowling leagues. At any rate, the wholesale manufacture of online profiles, for dating sites and any number of other online enterprises (think fake Twitter followers), is a big business overseas. Eastern Europe does a lot of this business paying their translators by the message. In the far east, young people sit in cubicles all day taking photos posted online and turning them into somebody elses profile. Sometimes, the people made up actually sound plausible. But, the truth is that online, when it comes to human relations on dating sites, nothing is quite what it sounds like. Buyer beware and all that. And so it is in the latest act of the tragedy that is an oversexed America, that millions of men who fell hook, line and sinker for slick and seductive marketing are now paying the price for wanting quick and easy excitement in their sex lives. All for nothing, too, as most of the profiles of women were faked. The question of whether or not it was worth it has been answered. The better query is how did so many otherwise smart men fall for the scam? ",1
2,"Boehner Finds His Spine, Invites Netanyahu To Address Congress On Iran The teleprompters had barely powered down from Barack Obamas sixth State of the Union Democratic applause fest, when John Boehner, the beleaguered Speaker of the House of Representatives, fired one heck of a shot across the administrations bow when it comes to foreign policy and bowing and scraping to Iran. From Associated Press via HotAir: House Speaker John Boehner said Wednesday he had invited Israels prime minister to address a joint meeting of Congress next month about the threats from Tehran and radical Islam. The Republican leader released a letter extending the invitation to Benjamin Netanyahu for Feb. 11. Well, alrighty then. If anyone speaks plainly and eloquently about Iran and what they are up to it is Mr. Netanyahu. And Boehner did it without consulting the White House which is a sort of breach of protocol, too. The White House usually does a lot of negotiating before an invitation is issued. But, surprise, surprise, surprise, that isnt all the news on John Boehner defying Obama. There was the Speakers response to Obamas threats regarding sanctions against Iran: Boehner also told a private meeting of GOP lawmakers that Congress would proceed on new penalties against Iran despite Obamas warning that any legislation would scuttle diplomatic negotiations over the countrys nuclear program. You may have seen that on Friday, the president warned us not to move ahead with sanctions on Iran, a state sponsor of terror, Boehner told colleagues, according to his office. His exact message to us was: Hold your fire. He expects us to stand idly by and do nothing while he cuts a bad deal with Iran. Two words: Hell no! This statement came from the purported wet noodle hours after Barack Obama proclaimed this in front of the entire government (except the Supreme Court conservatives who found other things more important than witnessing Obama make an idiot of himself). New sanctions passed by this Congress, at this moment in time, will all but guarantee that diplomacy fails alienating America from its allies, and ensuring that Iran starts up its nuclear program again. It doesnt make sense. That is why I will veto any new sanctions bill that threatens to undo this progress. The American people expect us to only go to war as a last resort, and I intend to stay true to that wisdom. As Democratic representative Bob Menendez tweeted, The more I hear from the administration the more it sounds like talking points that come straight out of Tehran. No kidding. Multiple lawmakers on both sides of the aisle are calling Obama on his assertions that the Iranian nuclear program has been halted. According to the HotAir sources, they are willing to openly challenge him on it, too. In the meantime, one must marvel at John Boehners masterstroke, as Ed Morrissey put it, of bypassing the administration on foreign policy sanctions and going straight to our most steadfast ally in the region for answers on Iran. Maybe now the long game will begin to play out. Yuck. If anyone speaks plainly and eloquently about Iran and what they are up to it is Mr. Netanyahu. If anyone spoke plainly and eloquently about Israel it was Ahmadinijad. Have him speak for BALANCE. What do you mean spine? The only thing this guy can be counted on is supporting that left-wing criminal welfare state called Israel. They should BOTH be arresed Boehner for treason and Nuttyahoo for espionage, stealing from the US (see Project Pinto.) ",4
2,"Operation Choke Point Victims Get Grievence Airing On Capitol Hill This Afternoon Of all the dirty stunts the Obama Administration pulled so far during his tenure, the nastiest, and most unAmerican has arguably been Operation Choke Point, the Justice Departments program that leans on the nations banks in order to get them to cut off objectionable businesses from avenues of banking and money flow. After years of stories surfacing that legitimate and successful businesses lost their banking relationships to this outrageous program, a hearing will occur on Capitol Hill with the HouseFinancial Services Subcommittee on Oversight and Investigations. They will question FDIC Chairman Martin Gruenberg, and hear stories from business owners caught in Operation Choke Points mousetrap. Rep. Sean Duffy, R-Wis., calls Operation Choke Point the greatest government overreach that no one is talking about. Many Americans agree. From the Daily Signal: The Justice Department maintains it has no interest in pursuing legal industries, but since then, the program has come under fire by Republicans in Congress for blocking many legal but politically unpopular business owners, like firearms and ammunition sellers, from the financial sector. These are the business industries known to be under fire: As most people concluded when this list surfaced, there are several types of businesses there that are either unethical or unsavory, but not illegal. If we as a culture and country do not like the presence of those businesses, laws need to be changed. The Justice Department has no call to try to close these enterprises on their own. Todays hearing will reportedly feature victims of Operation Choke Point who have made their stories known. We will see what Capitol Hill testimony will do to change the situation. ",3
2,"WATCH: Bill Nye, Science Guy Makes An Idiot Of Himself On Reproduction Not that this writer had all that great an affinity for Bill Nye anyway, but the video below has to be the most smug, snide, atheistic diatribe displaying outright willful ignorance and leftist talking points to grace youtube at least since Hillary Clinton talked about this subject. Ignoring the crack that the Bible is 5,000 years old, since the oldest parts of the Hebrew Septuagint are about 3,500 years old and the last book of the New Testament was written toward the end of the first century A.D. (that means Anno Domini, or the year of Our Lord), and the fact that a whole lot of characters of consequence in the Good Book were born to a women who really should never have conceived by the laws of nature, shall we talk about the science involved in human reproduction? Over at National Review, a trio of physicians pick apart the arguments using actual peer reviewed medical journal articles, but we can sum up what they have to say pretty easily. This is the pure science of when human life begins. It is true that not every time an egg is fertilized it implants, and babies are lost due to natural causes every day. This is called an act of God, or if one is not religious, Mother Nature. Mr. Nyes statements on that topic calling for the prosecution of women whose fertilized eggs do not implant in the uterine wall are patently stupid on their face. You wouldnt know how big a human egg is if it werent for microscopes. Uh, Billthe human ovum is the only sort of cell in a womans body that can be seen with the naked eye. It is true we would not know the gory details of the beauty of human reproduction without medical doctors putting cameras in some pretty private parts of women, but that does not cancel out the actual science itself that tells us a human being is created at fertilization. Bill Nye might be a science guy (engineer, actually), but hes no more an expert on human reproduction than Todd Akin is. What Nye is is a leftist tool who is spouting the feminist line that simplifies down to stupidity the excuses the left offers for why abortion should be tolerated in polite society, and why abstinence is undesirable as a way to prevent pregnancy when it is really 100% reliable as a way to do so. Without medical intervention, so far as we know, only one child was ever conceived without his mother knowing man. That has to say something for God. ",3
2,"House Bill Restrains Refugee Russian Roulette, Gives Rights To Citizens For those who fear the United States could devolve into the same type of chaotic mess that Europe has become and who find it asinine to import unvetted terrorists, a glimmer of hope has appeared on the political horizon. On Wednesday the House Judiciary Committee is scheduled to markup the Refugee Program Integrity Restoration Act (HR 4731), which is designed to restore self-determination to states and local governments in matters related to federally sanctioned human trafficking, the importation and dumping of foreigners by the federal government. States and local governments would be legally able to refuse to accept foreign refugees within their jurisdictions Under the current system, the State Departments nine contracted domestic resettlement agencies make the decisions as to which of 190 locations get saddled with the terror threats and the social problems. No input, agreement or informing of the impacted citizenry has been required. The bill also gives Congress the authority to reduce the overall refugee ceiling nationally to 60,000, down from its current level of 85,000 and climbing. A president would not be able to add to the number without congressional approval. The unilateral waiving of grounds of inadmissibility and deportability by a dictatorial and corrupt DHS Secretary would be specifically prohibited. There is also a requirement for federal officials to prioritize those asylum claims made by refugees who are fleeing religious persecution from countries designated as being of particular concern by the U.S. Commission on International Religious Freedom. Basically what the bill does is remove the subject avenues of abuse the Democrats have created in the pursuit of social and demographic engineering. House Immigration and Border Security Subcommittee Chairman and bill co-sponsor Raul Labrador (R-ID) said, To continue Americas long history of welcoming those in need, we must restore confidence in the safeguards protecting our security. Predictably, the open borders, anti-white lobbies denounced the bill based upon the typical false claims that it was punitive, mean-spirited, and would dismantle the U.S. refugee program. Their destructive agenda comes first, even ahead of national security. One of those agencies presently enjoying a financial windfall from the destruction of America, the Hebrew Immigrant Aid Society, now rebranded as HIAS, complained, It ties the hands of the U.S. government to respond to humanitarian crises. Of course the crisis theyre really concerned with is the financial one it will create for their organization. Their spokesperson, Melanie Nezer, was also critical of the provision that strips refugee status from those returning to their native land and another that extends the time period before a refugee can apply for permanent resident status by two years. Nezer, who is accustomed to dictating what Americans will accept whether they like it or not, stated that those changes were enacted for no legitimate reason. Recognizing the effect of the prioritizing requirement, Nezer also complained that placing a preference on those in certain religious minorities who are in actual physical peril would hinder our ability to take in anybody. It will hinder their ability to take in dollars. Maybe the government and their contractors shouldnt have been abusing the system and the American people in the first place and Congress wouldnt have felt compelled to take corrective action. The bill is being roundly criticized by all of the supposed religious refugee agencies who earn in the area of $4,755 per resettlement for their efforts, although none of them has the integrity to state the loss of revenue as the reason. Honesty and religious aid organizations can sometimes have trouble finding each other. For the record, the UN High Commissioner for Refugees says, The United States is the worlds top resettlement country. Weve done our part. Maybe somebody else can have a turn playing Russian roulette with their future.

2,"Catching HIV Virus Has Gotten Easier Nowadays Getting an HIV infection is easier than it used to be, thanks to the internet. Craigslist personal ads in any market increases HIV infection rates by 15.9 percent, according to research by Jason Chan, assistant professor of information and decision services at the Carlson School of Management at the University of Minnesota. The personals are invitations for relationships ranging from platonic to one-night stands.The researchers narroweddown the increase to the influence of the Craigslist personals, not the sites escort service ads. Their findings were consistent with other research that indicates that internet-facilitated sex workers arent as likely to engage in risky behaviors with clients. The research shows that the rise in HIV rates is consistent in 33 states over an eight-year period. The study was published in the Jan. 30, 2015, issue of MIS Quarterly. I actually think that the creators of Craigslist had no intent of harming society. They came in with good intentions, says Chan in the quarterly. At the same time, they did not anticipate that users could use the features in an unexpected way with unintended consequences. Chan and Professor Anindya Ghose of NYUs Stern School of Business based their claims after analyzing data in 33 states from 1999 to 2008. Because Craigslist randomly enters individual markets with respect to HIV trends, it provided a unique natural experiment setup from which the researchers could uncover the connection. When mapped nationally, more than 6,000 HIV cases annually and treatment costs estimated between $62 million and $65.3 million can be linked to the website, according the researchers. Our study results suggest that there is a new social route of HIV transmission that is taking place in this digital era, says Chan in the journal. Health care practitioners and policymakers have to look more closely at online platforms to assess how its usage may facilitate the spread of HIV and STDs across the country. According to Chan, the paper provides practitioners with insights on how they can effectively target their efforts to reduce disease transmission facilitated through classified ad sites. The Center for Disease Control has taken note of the findings and posted an early version of the paper its website. The paper is titled Internets Dirty Secret: Assessing the Impact of Online Intermediaries on HIV Transmission, Chan, J. and Ghose, A.,MIS Quarterly (December 2014) ",4

2,"WHOA! China Changes One Child Policy In an amazing change on one of the great demographic disasters of human history, China, another of the various old world countries cobbled together by appropriating provinces and countries that were previously on their own, at least for a little while, is abandoning its one child policy. Families may now have two children. China on Thursday said it would formally end its notorious one-child policy, which was intended to curb a surging population but has since been blamed for looming demographic problems in the worlds No. 2 economy. In a brief statement on Thursday, Chinas official Xinhua News Agency said all Chinese would be allowed to have two children. It didnt provide a time frame or any other details. China effectively hobbled the one-child policy two years ago, when it allowed couples to have two children if one parent came from a household without other siblings. It has also long allowed exceptions in some parts of the country. Chinas one child policy was instituted in 1980. In the intervening 35 years, China has seen a number of potentially detrimental social and economic issues crop up: These were consequences anyone with sense of how human nature works could have foretold. Now, China, one of the more oppressive regimes on the planet, has had to relent because their people were being human, and following the laws of base humanity. Imagine that. ",4
2,"[Watch] Tsunami of Illegals - A Government Sanctioned Invasion of America, Inside Information Fox News reporter Todd Starnes has excellent sources within different areas of the border crisis. He adds more evidence to the heaping piles that show this is a Democrat effort to flood the nation with their most favored demographic, and to transform us to a third-world socialist nation in the process. Starnes says he has multiple sources, both inside the camps as well as and inside BCFS, the security firm hired by the government to run them. He verifies earlier reports that employees, particularly health care workers, are under gag-orders to not speak of the conditions or the health of the children under a threat of the loss of their jobs and possible criminal prosecution. He also points out that a source within BCFS, the security firm running the camps, has told him that the orders for secrecy come from the federal government. They are more than willing to allow access if it were not for the restrictions put in place by the feds. Starnes reveals that some of the healthcare workers he has spoken to tell him that many of these kids want to go right back home, that they dont know why they were sent here to this country, and they want to go back to their moms and dads. He says this isnt reunification, this is a government sanctioned invasion of our country. He also questions who these kids are being sent home to here in the United States, when he hears from his sources that mom and dad are still back across the border in Central America. He then drops the money bomb, saying that he knows of many of the workers at the Lackland facility who are making $5,000 per week, and we tax payers are the ones footing the bill.

2,"Abby Johnson And Debunking The Planned Parenthood Tangled Spin Machine Just like everyone else who leans right, this writer has some well-meaning leftist friends who are pretty dependable when it comes to posting information meant to dispell any anxiety in liberal la la land caused by the extreme right-wing (whatever that is). In the last week, two of them have been busy posting apologetics for Planned Parenthood and unspinning the spin that seems to be making them dizzy. On the same day that the second video was released from the Center for Medical Progress showing a Planned Parenthood official haggling with potential brokers for baby body parts all for the cost of storage and transportation even if the facility doesnt actually do that FactCheck.org, a website run by the Annenberg Public Policy Center at the University of Pennsylvania, published a piece that obviously took some time to produce, but was just a day late to actually be credible beyond wishful thinking. the full, unedited video they cite as evidence shows a Planned Parenthood executive repeatedly saying its clinics want to cover their costs, not make money, when donating fetal tissue from abortions for scientific research. Four expertsin the field of human tissue procurement told usthe price range discussed in the video $30 to $100 per patient represents a reasonable fee. Theres no way theres a profit at that price, said Sherilyn J. Sawyer, the director of Harvard University and Brigham and Womens Hospitals biorepository. Heres the problem with that: why haggle over price and it being mutually satisfying, as the second video demonstrates, if theres no profit in it? Wouldnt the Planned Parenthood people have worked out a set price if the cash was utilitarian? At one point in the [first]unedited video (which was also released by the group), Nucatola says: Affiliates are not looking to make money by doing this. Theyre looking to serve their patientsand just make it not impact their bottom line. Nucatola also says, No ones going to see this as a money making thing. And at another point, she says, Our goal, like I said, is to give patients the option without impacting our bottom line. The messaging is this should not be seen as a new revenue stream, because thats not what it is. By definition, money coming in is a revenue stream, and serving patients without impacting the bottom linewithout this revenue, would Planned Parenthood seriously not be able to serve their patients? The federations profits are over a million dollars for the entire country annually (and the $500 million in cash from the government isnt listed on their Charity Navigator pageinFY2013, because that money goes to the affiliates as health services grants and reimbursements, not the parent organization according to p. 23 of the most recent annual report for FY 2014. Sneaky). That is the defense that FactCheck.org grabbedbefore they knew the second video was coming. At the same time, many Americans are wondering just how brazen can people be to flaunt Federal Law that carries with it penalties of $500,000 and ten years in jail if caught. Well, according to Planned Parenhood refugee, Abby Johnson, theres a loophole. She explained it to the Washington Times. The law currently states that there can be moneys exchanged as long as they fit under certain categories like preservation, collection, storage, transport, etc., Ms. Johnson said. And the law says there is not a maximum amount that can be charged or a minimum amount but that costs cannot be prohibitive. And thats very subjective. So, just like is done in the grant writing community where overhead is subjective, Planned Parenthood could set a price higher than is really necessary for preservation, collection, storage, transport, etc. Except that the physicians were talking about specific organs. At any rate, Ms. Johnson also explained that this sort of collection of tissue and transfer to research facilities is not out of the ordinary. At my affiliate, we did abortions at the time up until 16 weeks. You can begin harvesting fetal tissue at approximately eight weeks, Ms. Johnson said. Organs are present earlier, but you cant really decipher them until about 12 weeks. Thats not all of the organs, but some of the larger ones, you can pick those out and say, OK, this is a liver. And thats usually around 12 weeks. Johnson claims that once the day was finished, the staff would pack up what was salvagible, put in some dry ice and ship them off. In other words it happens all the time. Why? Because women sign the consent form for it to happen. They are convinced donating the baby to research will do somebody good someday. From an ethical standpoint, doing this with miscarried babies as that is Gods will is a completely different matter. This writer knows many people whose angels were donated to science. However that does not change that not many companies do this sort of work. Arthur Caplan, director of medical ethics at NYU Langone Medical Centers Department of Population Health, also raised the issue of high transfer costs, telling Reuters that only a few companies collect the fetal tissue and that they charge a lot for it. Im not sure people who donate it realize that, Mr. Caplan added. And that is the loophole activists like Abby Johnson say is exposed right along with Planned Parenthood with these videos. They [clinics] could say, Well, its more difficult for me to harvest a brain than it is for me to harvest a kidney, so that collection fee is going to be $1,000 for a brain, whereas its only going to be $400 for a kidney, Ms. Johnson said. And the problem is that its so subjective, the amount of money that can be charged. Thats really where we need reform. The Planned Parenthood spin machine has been working overtime to rescue the organization from the work of the Center for Medical Progress. The problem, though, is that even the uncut videos with protestations of we arent making any money are belied by the facts. Planned Parenthood can still charge what ever they want for the organs even if the excuse is to better serve their patients and make their financials come out even. ",3
2,"Americans And The Global Warming Public Relations Failure Because we have to survey EVERYTHING that might remotely smack of politics in the United States and make news with the news real or imagined, the Associated Press andNORC Center for Public Affairs Research (from the University of Chicago) did a rather in depth survey of just over a thousand Americans and asked their opinions on global warming after Pope Francis visit when he exhorted Americans to pay attention to Mother Earth. Answers to the questions on the pope himself have been withheld at this time for later publication, but an early release of the global warming questions and how the people answered regarding global warming and their opinions and attitudes toward the concept is available. Check out this graphic: Really, thats 39% of Americans are not too worried or not at all worried about global warming. (Only 16% of those surveyed actually DONT BELIEVE that global warming is happening, so the underground skeptics and deniers network has some work to do in breaking through the smokescreen of information the proponents have thrown up.) What is interesting about this entire exercise and the popes speeches on the topic is that there is a series of questions in the survey that more or less gives away the game: As the years have gone on with the global warming crowd making one chicken little type prediction after another trying to shame the people into giving up prosperous lifestyles and unlimited energy consumption in the name of saving the planet, the propaganda was meant to make a moral issue out of stopping man-made climate change. Not that there is anything wrong with caring for the environment, and being good stewards of the earth, but the global warming people want to bankrupt us in order to stop anthropologic climate change that does not appear to actually be happening. And like everything else thats been used to get Americans to give up their freedoms, the environmentalists tried to use fear to get the people to go along with the idea right next to morality. So far, it appears that while the message of man actually changing the environment might be penetrating, the alarm that was supposed to be generated next to it has not materialized. With the big Climate Change Conference coming up in Paris later this month, look for a lot more THE SKY IS FALLING stories to come from the mainstream media. The previous waves of global warming propaganda did not work as intended. They will undoubtedly try another angle. Quick aside: there is a scandal brewing at the Vatican as the people advising the pope have excluded climate skeptics from the group of scientists making climate recommendation. As a Catholic, this writer will tell the reader that this is contrary to the normal way of doing things. All sides are supposed to be considered and His Holiness is depending on the wrong people to advise him. H/T Watts Up With That ",3
2,"Proof Its No Accident, No Surprise - Conducted Last Year - Fed Govt-Funded University Studies on Border Crisis, UACs The University of Texas, El Paso created a report recently that relates directly to the influx of illegals on the Mexican border. It was conducted in 2013 and completed prior to the current increased illegal activity, and may have been commissioned as a barometer for just how effective the schemes of DHS and the Obama regime might be expected to be. The report starts by referencing the increased illegal immigration of the last three years, and the associated increase in Other Than Mexican (OTM) unaccompanied alien children (UAC). The report cites a need on behalf of the enforcement agencies of the DHS to meet the requirements of the Flores v. Reno Settlement Agreement, which stipulates the placement criteria for UAC. The HHS Office for Refugee and Resettlement (ORR) is responsible for long-term placement in contracted shelters while awaiting immigration hearings. That is not a small point that should be overlooked. The UAC are already being placed into the custody of a body that prejudges them to be refugees in need of resettlement. The report quotes statistics which show a 367.6 percent increase since fiscal year 2011 in the number of UACs in the Rio Grande Valley/Harlingen Field Office. In the fall of 2013, the research team from UTEP conducted several fact-finding trips to multiple Border Patrol and ICE facilities to gather information for their report. They conducted interviews with the agents who are involved in dealing with the UACs on a daily basis. UTEP researchers found that both the Border Patrol and ICE officers with whom they spoke pointed to an awareness of a lack of consequences on the part of the illegal aliens as a chief contributing factor to the problem. The government respondents told the researchers that the smugglers and human cargo are aware that once the illegals are apprehended, they will be re-united with a U.S. based family pending an immigration hearing. They recognize that the process is being exploited by those wishing to use the resources of the United States to violate immigration laws. Enforcement and Removal Operations (ERO) officials told the researchers of their belief that the numbers of illegal UACs will continue to increase until enforcement of the law is once again resumed. They anticipate, absent enforcement, the best-case scenario to be a leveling out of UAC numbers. The agents identified the primary factor in the placement of UACs is the availability of a shelter. A shelter that is overfilled can lose its license, so they are very careful not to exceed approved levels. Of course, no such requirements exist for military bases and other locations which are being used for the staging and warehousing of the invaders at present. Still, once an individual has physically left a shelter, their space can be used to import another illegal, so the push from DHS and the lawless Obama regime is strong to move people through the system quickly. The UTEP report also indicates that roughly thirty percent of UACs are identified as having special needs such as pregnancy, mental illness, physical handicaps and those under age two. Special needs individuals are placed at the front of the line. That policy is a bit hard to understand. Illegals who will assuredly be a burden on the taxpayer, those incubating anchor babies, mentally ill, or physically handicapped, as well as WIC candidates are given a priority into the country. Upon just what basis was it determined that mental illness and other potentially negative characteristics are a criterion for fast track acceptance into American society? Only a limited amount of special needs-compliant shelters are available in the 12 which serve the Rio Grande Valley (RGV). The result of that limited space and the shortage created through special needs designations is greater pressure to move illegal invaders into the interior of the country and into the shadows of private facilities. This research was done prior to the current explosion at the border, when things were still largely going on behind a curtain of DHS secrecy, guided by Obamas secretary of open borders, DHS chief, Jeh Johnson. There is more to the story; you can read the report for yourself at thislink, or wait for my follow-up tomorrow.

2,"Congressman Takes Major Step Towards Obama Impeachment, Regime Trials An effort is underway by the United States Patriots Union, through Congress, in the form of a resolution being offered by Rep Ted Yoho (R-FL) to finally begin the process of investigating and holding the criminal Obama regime accountable for their treason against the United States. The resolution, to be introduced this week, calls for the creation of a Special Select Committee, in cooperation with a Special Task Force established by the FBI for the purpose of investigating alleged high crimes and misdemeanors. The Select Committee would issue its results in a report to the House Judiciary Committee in matters specified as: (1) all policies, decisions, and activities that may meet the standard of high crime or misdemeanor, especially related to aiding and abetting known enemies of the United States, weakening United States sovereignty and security; (2) all policies, decisions, and activities within the Obama Administration related to border security and illegal immigration, as well as current Administration policies related to Middle Eastern refugee resettlement activities as they pertain to national security; (3) internal and public executive branch communications about economic policy, foreign policy, Military readiness and Rules of Engagement, illegal immigration, Middle Eastern refugee resettlement, the attacks on United States facilities in Benghazi, Libya, on September 11, 2012, events surrounding the downing of Extortion 17, August 6, 2011, Fast and Furious gun running on the southern border, and other alleged arms dealing in the Middle East that may have aided and armed ISIL (ISIS) or other known terror organizations, involving the Department of State and the Department of Justice; (4) accountability for policies and decisions related to the security and force protection for all Military, Intelligence, Contract and Diplomatic members on foreign deployment in the interest of the United States, in particular throughout the Middle East since January 20, 2009, including individuals and entities responsible for those policies and decisions; (5) executive branch authorities efforts to identify and bring to justice the perpetrators of the attacks on U.S. facilities in Benghazi, Libya, on September 11, 2012, the downing of Extortion 17 in the Wardak Province, Tangi River Valley, Afghanistan, August 6, 2011, and the Raven 23 incident, Nisour Square, Iraq, September 16, 2007; (6) executive branch activities and efforts to obstruct Congressional inquiries into the attacks on United States facilities in Benghazi, Libya, on September 11, 2012 and the downing of Extortion 17, August 6, 2011, as well as illegal Executive Orders misusing Federal Agencies to target constitutionally protected rights of specific classes of Americans on the basis of race, religion or political affiliations; (7) executive branch activities and policies regarding compliance with standing court orders to cease and desist aiding and abetting illegal immigration, and the persons responsible for those decisions and policies, and illegal Executive Orders forcing Immigration Officers to violate the 1986 Immigration Reform Act and all standing immigration and naturalization laws; (8) information related to lessons learned from the attacks and executive branch activities and efforts to protect United States facilities and personnel abroad; and recommendations to the House Judiciary Committee on the best path for holding individuals fully accountable for any and all acts which threatened or weakened national sovereignty and security, directly or indirectly, and whether or not those activities are believed to involve malice or ill intent; and (9) any other relevant issues relating to national sovereignty and security, and any measures taken to remedy any policy decisions which may demonstrate malice or ill intent on the part of any Obama Administration official, including by the President or Vice President. Theres enough included in the resolution to keep the entire Justice Department occupied for years, due to the volume of criminality and associated activities which must be investigated. The US government has become the largest organized crime organization in the world under this and previous administrations although there is no doubt that the levels of anti-American activity have increase exponentially under this current criminal regime, most significantly in the DHS under the boundless treachery and corruption of Secretary Jeh Johnson. While some might argue that its a little late in the game to be taking this action now, and there is no denying that Congress should have acted years ago, our situation could become much worse as the final days of the regime draw near, and they slip even more into a reckless abandon mode. At a minimum, the knowledge that an investigation and possible criminal consequences exists may serve to rein in the dictator and his minions to a degree. Organizers of the effort include the United States Patriots Union. The original press release, along with the names of Congressmen to contact in support, can be viewed here.

2,"NASA On 2014 Being The Warmest Year On Record: Were Pretty Sure, Yeah, Thats It Now that all The Sky Is Falling headlines have further cemented the idea that man-made global warming via excess carbon is actually happening, it seems that the computer model used by NASA to make that claim in the last week has a fairly large margin for error: In a press release on Friday, Nasas Goddard Institute for Space Studies (GISS) claimed its analysis of world temperatures showed 2014 was the warmest year on record. As a result [of the 3,000 measuring stations having a large margin of error], GISSs director Gavin Schmidt has now admitted Nasa thinks the likelihood that 2014 was the warmest year since 1880 is just 38 per cent. And then there was the little tidbit that this increase was two hundreths of a degree Celsius (thats 0.02, as in it was teeny tiny), which is several times smaller than the one tenth of a degree margin of error. The Daily Mail, the origin of the quotes above, wanted to be sure that the NASA data misrepresentation admission was yet not another smoke and mirrors incident, so they consulted a different study of similar data over the same time frame: Another analysis, from the Berkeley Earth Surface Temperature (BEST) project, drawn from ten times as many measuring stations as GISS, concluded that if 2014 was a record year, it was by an even tinier amount. Its report said: Numerically, our best estimate for the global temperature of 2014 puts it slightly above (by 0.01C) that of the next warmest year (2010) but by much less than the margin of uncertainty. Therefore it is impossible to conclude from our analysis which of 2014, 2010, or 2005 was actually the warmest year the Earths average temperature for the past decade has changed very little. Well, isnt that special. According to all the reports, greenhouse gas emissions have sky-rocketed and the earths temperature doesnt seem to be changing. Well, not by much anyway. At least one scientist, though, is willing to entertain the idea that non-human variables effect the earth at a global level: Since the earth is several billion years old science doesnt particularly have a consensus on that, either and it was a lot hotter not even a thousand years ago, and then a lot colder MANY times, it could well be non-human factors are more of a force than not. For now, however, there is an argument on just how many hundreths of a degree the earth warmed last year. That humans are to blame does not seem to be in doubt. If ya cant make it, fake it! ",3

2,"Iran With A Nuke Is Al Qaeda With A Nuke... Washington Kiss Your Ass Goodbye! I am shocked and still have a hard time believing that Kerry and Obama are still moving forward with nuclear talks with Iran. I often ask myself do they love their kids or hate this country more. I am certain that most lawmakers in Washington love their children and grandchildren. Then why are traitors still living free in our society much less allowed to negotiate with Iran. Its only a matter of time before Iran has the bomb no thanks to the traitors in this administration.When Iran gets the bomb it is certain Al Qaeda will have the weapon. Washington seems to have forgotten the morning of 9-11 and all those who were lost. If it werent for the passengers of flight 93 a lot of these politicians wouldnt be here today. Most politicians are educated, but very few have any common sense. Iran gets nuclear weapons, its only a matter of time before Washington becomes a nuclear wasteland. Wake the hell up Washington or the last thing you will see is a big flash of light. Iran hates us just like many other terror organizations in this world. Obama and Kerry are mixing up company with those who wish to kill us while turning their backs on those who would die protecting us. They do not have our childrens future in their thoughts while kissing the ass of those who wish to destroy us. Remove these men from office before their friends remove all of us from this world. God bless America Semper Fi, Shep When Iran gets the bomb it is certain Al Qaeda will have the weapon is like Churchill saying in 1943: If Stalin gets the bomb, he will give it to Hitler, who will then nuke London! It makes absolutely no sense at all. Iran is shia-muslim nation. al-Qaeda and ISIS are sunni-muslim organizations, who hate the shias even more than they hate the west. ISIS is actually bombing shia mosques in Saudi-arabia already. If al-Qaeda or ISIS would get a nuke, it is more likely theyd use it on Iranian capital Tehran (to gain regional power) than that theyd use it against the west. Iran will not be so stupid as to give nukes to their enemies. Iran has a lot more to fear from us than we do from them after all, we overthrew their government in 1951 and we installed the Shah of Iran. Anyone who thinks that Iran is the aggressor has not read US/Iran history. Well, .you are either a militant muslim or far left liberal who hates the Jews. There is no basis whatsoever for your ignorant, hateful, racist slams against the Jewish people. Applicable Sure, Israel has some things they do that I would call them out on but for you to sit there and type that Iran would be a better ally than Israel is either blind ignorance of history or hate and arrogance towards America. I would also like to ask you why you specifically mentioned only whites and Christians. Are you thinking these two variables are your target audience in this thread and that mentioning specifics will insure you a bigger kill rate concerning your being antagonistic here? When you speak about only one race of people and a singular religion, its as if you have never seen anything of the world other than what someone else told you about or what to believe. No doubt that Iran already has the bomb, only question is where and when they will use it. DC GAZETTE CHASING ISLAM IS NOT A NUKE THREAT THE MATTER OF FACT THREAT IS RUSSIA FOR USA! RUSSIAN PRESIDENT PUTIN AGAIN WARNED NATO COUNTRIES TO STOP ARMING UKRAINE AND RUSSIAN SURROUNDING COUNTRIES OTHER WISE BE READY TO FACE OFF NUKE LOADED MISSILE IN THE RETALIATION? EARLIER MONTHS AGO PUTIN SAID IN MILAN ITALY, 5000 NUKE;S LOAD MISSILE ARE READY SO NATO TURN TO ISLAMIC STATE BECAUSE THEY DONT HAVE NUKE AND THEY ARE BABIES? ANOTHER DANGEROUS SIGN OF NUKE ATTACK IS FROM NATURE? MIAMI NUCLEAR PLANT IS IN RED SIGN? SINKING IN OCEAN ALONG WITH MIAMI CITY ? IF ANY CYCLONE OR THUNDER OR TYPE OF TYPHOON HIT MIAMI AND ITS NUCLEAR PLANT SO HALF OF FLORIDA WILL BE LIKE FUKUSHIMA? BUT THE QUESTION IS WHO WILL CARE AMERICA? PRESIDENT CARE ONLY TWO CRISIS ONE GLOBAL CRISIS ANOTHER LGBT AND SAME SEX MARRIAGES? GOP AND REPUBLICANS CARES HOW TO SUPPORT ISRAEL AND HOW TO PULL LEG OF PRESIDENT AND HIS TEAM ? SO WHO WILL CARE NATION AND NATIONAL CRISIS ? Having lived in Israel, and having relatives high up in the Israeli military, I can tell you that Israel, since the 70s, has had nukes aimed at every major Muslim city in the Middle East. All the Muslim countries are afraid of Iran because they know that WHEN, NOT IF Iran launches against Israel the Middle East will cease to exist. The Saudis hate Israel, yet would let Israeli planes fly the shortcut over Saudi Arabia to destroy the seven underground labs making the Iranian nukes. What are you blathering about. There are 2 million Christian Israeli citizens. There are 2 million Muslim Israeli citizens. There are 4 million black and white Jewish Israeli citizens. All have equal religious freedom, equal free education, equal free healthcare and equal representation in Israels government. At 17 all those religions must serve in the Israeli army.The Muslim citizens are the envy of the Muslim world in the Middle East, for all their freedom. Stop being a low IQ, gullible, useful idiot for your white trash, white supremacist handlers. They need to be stopped while theres still time. They need to be arrested and hanged for treason. But it will not happen. This will continue until it all plays out. Nobody believes it because they dont want to. All I plan to do, therefore, is hunker down, provide for and defend my own till my last breath. If that breath comes while exercising my right to bear arms, then so be it. Others will surely pass with me. Unfortunately, they will have been forced into that position by tyrants. You people whose oath is to defend the Constitution better open your eyes. The globalist agents and anti-Americans in DC, want to be attacked so they, the traitors in DC, have an excuse to initiate martial law in the US and finally destroy the Constitution, Bill of Rights, and individuals freedoms, rights, and liberties so that their neo-feudalism and enslavement agenda can be completed. Yeah thats why Iranians were in the streets chanting death to America, the great satan..because they love us This water-carrying for Israel is getting embarrassing for you. Step away from the AIPAC boilerplate. Iran would make a better ally than Israel ever would. Israel despises Whitesdespises Christians. This is deeply ingrained in their nature. Stop being a useful idiot for them.or are you getting paid off? Do any of you really believe that Otraitor or Ferry care? When/if the missiles come, theyll be tucked away safe sound in their prospective bunkers sipping Champagne and laughing at the rest of us. ",3
2,"EPA Strikes Again: Another Mine Spill Accident This is becoming a habit with the screw-ups at the Environmental Protection Agency, an oxymoron if there ever was one with their recent track record. The dingbats triggered yet ANOTHER release of water contaminated with heavy metals into a small stream that feeds into a larger river that serves as a water source for people living in rural Colorado. This time the Standard Mine was upstream from Crested Butte, the stream is really more of a creek, and there were ONLY 2,000 gallons spilled rather than a few million, but does this sound familiar? From the Denver Post: The Standard Mine, five miles west of Crested Butte and abandoned, has been designated an environmental disaster since 2005 and targeted for a superfund cleanup. It is one of an estimated 230 inactive mines in Colorado that state officials know to be leaking toxic heavy metals into headwaters of the nations rivers. The spill happened at 1:30 p.m. Tuesday, and the EPA said it immediately informed public works officials. Residents werent notified. Crested Butte Mayor Aaron Huckstep said he wasnt notified until Thursday. Subsequent investigation found no visible plume or signs of significant impacts in downstream locations, the EPA said. At the cleanup site, acidic wastewater laced with cancer-causing cadmium and other toxic heavy metals leaches out of the mine into Elk Creek, which flows into Coal Creek a primary source of water for Crested Butte. The Colorado Department of Public Health and Environment has determined that the levels of arsenic, cadmium and zinc in Coal Creek exceed state standards. Yet again, the EPA is protecting the environment by using heavy equipment and disturbing the seepage at abandoned mining sites that were at least locally dealt with before the EPA decided to clean them up. In this case, EPA crew members were drilling a new opening at the mine, parallel to a portal that is partially collapsed. They were using a vacuum truck to siphon water from a waste pond, but the truck dipped too low, the EPAs statement said, causing grey-colored water from inside the mine and sediment to spill into Elk Creek. Adding insult to injury, the EPA told public works officials, but not the residents or officials higher up on the food chain who could actually get word out to the public quickly. This is a bad habit the EPA has of not telling the whole truth to the people most effected by the messes they make. With this EPA protecting the environment even if abandoned mines are seeping heavy metals into the headwaters in Colorado, one has to wonder what the real goal of the clean-up superfund is really get the heavy metals out of the water or make that part of Colorado uninhabitable.

2,"The Questions Cecile Richards Of Planned Parenthood WASNT Asked Yesterday, after sitting through the full morning of Republican offensive and Democrat defensive questions and commentary to Cecile Richards, President of PLANNED PARENTHOOD FEDERATION OF AMERICA, not all the doggone affiliates, this writer registered her dismay at the Republican effort. Frankly, it was more about throwing red meat to the conservative base than getting questions answered. We all know that Planned Parenthood doesnt do mammograms. Getting Cecile Richards to admit that was no great feat. The president of any organization does not set the price of his or her compensation. That is done at the board of directors level. (And in Ms. Richards case, $500,000 might be considered combat pay.) The big time questioning of and answers about parties and lavish private travel needs to come from the board itself and the non-governmental big time donors whose cash is being used for this. None of those people were witnesses to be questioned. Bringing up unseemly spending makes great headlines, but was completely beside the point. To be honest, John McCormack is correct in his Weekly Standard piece How Not To Make Planned Parenthood Squirm. Rep. Jason Chaffetz, Chairman of the House Oversight and Government Reform Committee, doomed the hearing from the start when he took any questioning of the revelations from the Center for Medical Progress videos off the table. Because of that, no one could ask: If Planned Parenthood officials and the Democrats just want to talk about legality, then start there. (The moral side of the question will never be settled in a committee hearing, anyway.) Those were topics openly discussed in the videos and the justification for all of it is what WILL make somebody on the hot seat from Planned Parenthood squirm, not discussion of questionable spending. It is quite possible all that pre-dates Ms. Richards time at Planned Parenthood, and if so, its obviously part of the institutional culture. (Thats a matter for another post, hiding evil in the shadows.) When it comes to the financial side of the house, there is a lot of noise about the $500 million that goes to the AFFILIATES, not the 501(c)(3) that Richards actually runs, that is reimbursement for medicaid payments. Once the paper trail at the state and affiliate level is sorted out, and we see just how much the safety net that Planned Parenthood provides costs, why are the poor and indigent being served with medicaid dollars for this? As a charity, Ms. Richards discussed fundraising and how successful the people of Planned Parenthood are at it. So the question in finance that did not get asked is: With amazing name recognition from coast to coast, why not go the mass market fundraiser route, a la, walks, bike rides, marathons, 3-day events, that so many other health care related non-profits have, in order to raise the money to be able to offer the poor these services at no cost to them or the taxpayers? Having been part of these events at one of the national disease related charities, it can be arranged for each affiliate to keep the cash locally, especially since they are all separate entities anyway. Software to make it all happen easily is commercially available. Staffing needs can be met quite easily with a skeleton crew and volunteers. (Thats how everyone does it.) What is stopping Planned Parenthood from going this route? No one asked that question, at least not in that form. (The answer is most likely bad press in the form of protests, but still.) Specifics on the grants to the national organization werent requested, either. At least not that I saw. There should be reports to the government available outlining how the money was spent. More or less, the meat and potatoes of this matter is still on the platter to be devoured. The videos themselves provide grist for the moral mill and for people who believe in the sanctity of life, but thats not for a congressional committee to do much more than expose. The change of heart on that has to come from the people. The law so touted by the pro-death people was imposed, not legislated. Cecile Richards, or somebody else at Planned Parenthood, still has not answered the big questions. The bigger conundrum iswill someone actually ask them? ",3
2,"MMA Sensation Ronda Rousey: I Try to Have as Much Sex as POSSIBLE... [Source1/Source2] VideoSource gifSource Check out Ronda Rouseys 9 SEXIEST PICSBYParis Seude From biography.com Ronda Jean Rousey was born on February 1, 1987, in Riverside, California. Born with her umbilical cord wrapped around her neck, Rousey nearly died from a lack of oxygen and sustained slight brain damage, which impeded her ability to speak an intelligible word until she was 6. A tragedy fell upon the family when Rouseys dad, Ron, broke his back while sledding with his daughters. A blood disorder prevented him from healing properly, and after learning he would be a paraplegic in the few years he had left to live, he committed suicide when Rousey was 8. Rousey struggled in class and was homeschooled for parts of elementary and high school, but she found an outlet for her frustration when her mom, AnnMaria De Mars, persuaded her to learn judo. A gold medalwinning judoka at the 1984 World Championships, De Mars began drilling her daughter in some of the sports fundamentals, most notably the dreaded armbar used to pin an opponent to the mat. Rousey was named to the United States Olympic team at age 15, and at 16 she became the youngest American to earn the national No. 1 ranking in the womens half-middleweight division. Although she didnt earn a medal at the 2004 Olympics, she claimed gold at that years World Junior and Pan American Judo Championships. After defending her Pan American Judo Championship title in 2006, Rousey became the first American woman in 12 years to earn a World Championship medal by finishing second in the 2007 tournament. She then won gold at the 2007 Pan American Games, despite a torn knee meniscus. After earning the bronze medal at the 2008 Olympics, she retired from judo at age 21. Unsure of what to do in the wake of her judo career, Rousey worked as a bartender and lived out of her car for a spell in Los Angeles. She eventually joined the Glendale Fighting Club and in August 2010 made her amateur debut in mixed martial arts, a victory by way of an armbar after just 23 seconds. Two more amateur bouts ended via armbar submission after 57 and 24 seconds, respectively. Rousey continued her run of domination after turning pro in the sport, reeling off four straight wins in under a minute apiece. In March 2012, she became the Strikeforce Womens Bantamweight Champion by defeating Miesha Tate in four minutes and 27 seconds. By this point, Rousey had become a crossover star with her good looks and penchant for first trash-talking and then brutally dispatching her opponents. She was featured on a cover ofESPN The Magazines 2012 Body Issue, and appeared as a guest on Conan OBriens talk show. After one more speedy victory, Rousey was the first woman to sign with the Ultimate Fighting Championship, the worlds largest mixed martial arts league. Designated Bantamweight Champion, she successfully defended her belt in the inaugural UFC womens bout in February 2012, submitting Liz Carmouche via her patented armbar in four minutes and 49 seconds, her longest fight at that point. In the summer of 2013, Rousey appeared in another sexy photo spread, forMaxim, and announced plans to star in the action filmsThe Expendables 3(released in 2014) andFurious 7(2015).At the end of 2013, she won a rematch with Tate that extended to the third round, suggestingshe was losing her touch as the dominant force of the UFC womens circuit. However, Rousey recorded a first-round win in her following bout, and then proceeded to crush her next two opponents in a combined time of 30 seconds. With her 34-second demolition of Bethe Correia in August 2015, it was clear Rousey remained in a class of her own as a fighter. by: American Godfather ",4
2,"Scientists Restore Mans Sight Imagine being in the darkest place possible, where you cant see even the slightest bit of the hand in front of your face. Now imagine being stuck in that darkness for half your life. Sixty-six-year-old Larry Hester has been in that place for the past 33 years. In his mid-thirties, Hester was diagnosed with a hereditary degenerative eye disease called retinitis pigmentosa. This disease causes the light-sensitive retinas to deteriorate. It has no known cure. On September 10, Larry became the seventh recipient in the country of a bionic eye implant, a.k.a. Second Sight Argus II Retinal Prosthesis Device. This device consists of a chip implanted into the eye, a video camera, and special glasses worn by the patient. It captures video on the camera mounted onto the glasses, translating it into an electrical signal. The signal gets wirelessly sent to the chip connected to the part of the retina that is undamaged. Once the signal reaches the chip, the brain interprets it as contrasting pieces of light and dark. Patrick Finnerty of Second Sight Medical Products explains it this way: The patient can see flashes of light and a pixelated type of vision that helps him distinguish between objects in his field of view. Dr. Paul Hahn, Hesters eye surgeon, explained that although it does not give the patient full vision like most people are used to having, it does help him navigate around doors, windows, etc. After weeks of recovery, Hester returned to Duke Eye Center on October 7 to start therapy. A video broadcast by Duke captures the moment when Dr. Hahn turned the device on, the first time since the device was implanted. Cheers went up when Hester immediately flinched at the sudden light. Smiles and hugs were given all around as Hester continued meeting the test standards. Doctors and family members alike joined hands in a circle for a moment of prayer, led by a humble and truly grateful Larry Hester. Its so basic; and to anybody else it would be just flashes of light, but to me it meansI can see, Hester said, breaking down in tears as he was interviewed after the test. This is very special. This is a gift. Family members walked him outside to see the moon for the first time in 30 years. So far, he has been able to see light-colored flowers against brown mulch, and a white duck on a pond. He is hoping that by next summer he will be able to see the light contrasts of the Fourth of July fireworks in his hometown. For now, he only turns the device on for about half an hour per day to let his brain adjust to having vision after half a lifetime of blindness. Jerry Hester, Larrys wife, spoke with reporters after the tests: We have prayed a lot about it, our friends and family have, and we have a wonderful support group of people that are cheering for himSeeing a bit of Gods creation that weve had this opportunity, a second chance thats a special time.

2,"U.S. Internet Surrender Stalled Saying that the international agreement for the United States of America to sign over control of the internet from its ownership needs more work,Assistant Secretary for Communications and Information and NTIA Administrator Lawrence E. Strickling wrote in a blog post Monday that surrender of the internet to international forces will be put off for at least a year, and the currentagreement withnonprofit Internet Corporation for Assigned Names and Numbers (ICANN) might well be renewed for an additional three years. When we announced our intent in March 2014 to complete the privatization of the DNS, we noted that the base period of our contract with ICANN to perform technical functions related to the DNS, known as the IANA functions, expired on September 30, 2015. However, it has become increasingly apparent over the last few months that the community needs time to complete its work, have the plan reviewed by the U.S. Government and then implement it if it is approved. Accordingly, in May we asked the groups developing the transition documents how long it would take to finish and implement their proposals. After factoring in time for public comment, U.S. Government evaluation and implementation of the proposals, the community estimated it could take until at least September 2016 to complete this process. In response to their feedback, we informed Congress on Friday that we plan to extend our IANA contract with ICANN for one year to September 30, 2016. Beyond 2016, we have options to extend the contract for up to three additional years if needed. Extend ICANNs contract if neededgiven the goals of this group as outlined by the New York Times: The Commerce Department said the new governing body could not be a government-led or intergovernmental organization. It also stipulated that the new group must maintain the structure and stability of the domain name system, along with the openness of the Internet. May as well just hand it over to Julian Assange and WikiLeaks, then. Its either him or the United Nations if the intention is to keep it running and even then the internet being as free and open as it is is iffy. The United States is one of the few countries that actually believes in the concept of free speech. So, handover of one of the USAs true technological achievements to forces that may well want to destroy us has been postponed. Strickling seems to think the outstanding issues and public commentary can be dealt with in the next yearbut has a contract extension in his back pocket if necessary. Any takers on this handover being postponed until a Republican is in the White House and then the executive order torn up? Yeah, me neither. ",4
2,"Soros To Hillary: Clean Up On Aisle 9 - ONE ORDER FROM THE PUPPETMASTER The title on the story at The Blaze reads, Newly Released Emails Reveal Billionaire Donor George Soros Sent Clinton Foreign Policy Advice. Read the actual email as George Soros himself wrote it, and one gets the impression that this wasnt really advice. It was more like marching orders. Dear Hillary, A serious situation has arisen in Albania which needs urgent attention at senior levels of the US government. You may know that an opposition demonstration in Tirana on Friday resulted in the deaths of three people and the destruction of property. There are serious concerns about further unrest connected to a counter-demonstration to be organized by the governing party on Wednesday and a follow-up event by the opposition two days later to memorialize the victims. The prospect of tens of thousands of people entering the streets in an already inflamed political environment bodes ill for the return of public order and the countrys fragile democratic process. I believe two things need to be done urgently: 1. Bring the full weight of the international community to bear on Prime Minister Berisha and opposition leader Edi Rama to forestall further public demonstrations and to tone down public pronouncements. 2. Appoint a senior European official as a mediator. While I am concerned about the rhetoric being used by both sides, I am particularly worried about the actions of the Prime Minister. There is videotape of National Guard members firing on demonstrators from the roof of the Prime Ministry. The Prosecutor (appointed by the Democratic Party) has issued arrest warrants for the individuals in question. The Prime Minister had previously accused the opposition of intentionally murdering these activists as a provocation. After the tape came out deputies from his party accused the Prosecutor of planning a coup detat in collaboration with the opposition, a charge Mr. Berisha repeated today. No arrests have been made as of this writing. The demonstration resulted from opposition protests over the conduct of parliamentary elections in 2009. The political environment has deteriorated ever since and is now approaching levels of 1997, when similar issues caused the country to slide into anarchy and violence. There are signs that Edi Ramas control of his own people is slipping, which may lead to further violence. The US and the EU must work in complete harmony over this, but given Albanias European aspirations the EU must take the lead. That is why I suggest appointing a mediator such as Carl Bildt. Martti Ahtisaari or Miroslav Lajcak, all of whom have strong connections to the Balkans. My foundation in Tirana is monitoring the situation closely and can provide independent analysis of the crisis. Thank you, George Soros Three days later, Hillary Clinton, then Secretary of State, appointed Miroslav Lajcak as mediator for the Albanian situation. What was actually happening in January of 2011 to prompt this missive from Soros regarding a tiny Islamic European country that sits between Greece and the nations that were once thrown together in the form of Yugoslavia along the Adriatic Sea, obviously would have upset some sort of plan Soros had at the time. He desperately needed the unrest to go away. That being the case, he writes Hillary via channels at the State Department (heres the Wikileaks link for the email) and she does his bidding even if the situation really was more of a European problem. Interesting. Whats more interesting is that this email chain appears within the 2011-2012 time frame of Hillarys emails that the State Department appears not to have. The emails themselves were buried in a cache of Hillarys finest published by Wikileaks in March of 2016. The sources of the text actually were not Hillarys email itself, but state.gov addresses of her underlings. The way THOSE emails read, it appears that they were follow-ups to other communications. As scintillating reading as the Hillary Clinton email cache must be (ZZZZZ) one does have to admit that these delicious bombshells make wading through them worth it. Even if all thats happening is conformation of what so many people have suspected for years. ",3
2,"Scientists Fill In The Periodic Table A Little, Bask In The Glow This weeks news from the world of chemistry gives new meaning to whipping up something in the lab. No, the science crazy sorts did not invent a woman, or some reasonable facsimile, they quite literally invented, uh, discovered four new elements, and added them to the Periodic Table. The elements, discovered by scientists in Japan, Russia and America, are the first to be added to the table since 2011, when elements 114 and 116 were added. The four were verified on 30 December by the US-based International Union of Pure and Applied Chemistry, the global organisation that governs chemical nomenclature, terminology and measurement. IUPAC announced that a Russian-American team of scientists at the Joint Institute for Nuclear Research in Dubna and Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory in California had produced sufficient evidence to claim the discovery of elements 115, 117 and 118. The body awarded credit for the discovery of element 113, which had also been claimed by the Russians and Americans, to a team of scientists from the Riken institute inJapan. This was The Guardians version. CNN gave away the true secret of the invention, uh, discoveries: With the words decay extremely quickly it can be extrapolated that the quartet are radioactive, or at least start out that way. (113 is said to be more radioactive than Plutonium.) That they fill in the seventh row of the Periodic Table makes them heavy. Anything at the bottom is a heavy atom, in this case superheavy. (Gases go across the top, as do natural elements that make up the building blocks of life. Lighter than air and all that.) That they arent naturalwho cares. Chemists are on to elements 119 and 120 which dont exist yet. The four new colors, oops, elements are ununtrium, (Uut or element 113), ununpentium (Uup, element 115), ununseptium (Uus, element 117), and ununoctium (Uuo, element 118), although those will not be their real names until theInternational Union of Pure and Applied Chemistry (IUPAC) finalizes the names. Exactly what these elements will be used for is anyones guess. In the meantime, the scientific community is positively orgasmic at the development that is considered on par with Olympic gold metals, and one would have to assume, sex. At least their good news has nothing to do with the Kardashians. ",3

2,"Why Arent Secret Service Miscreants Being Fired? Congress Hasnt Exempted Them From Federal Labor Laws Sometimes, Congressional hearings do actually do some good. See, Congress has had it with the Secret Service. Several members from both sides of the aisle want the agency to let the people who have been causing all the scandal go. Quickly. From the Washington Examiner: You have got to have a system that has robust accountability, Rep. Ron DeSantis, R-Fla., insisted at a hearing earlier this week. And thats the question that were looking at today, where is the accountability in the agency? It just seems throughout this saga with different problems, theres no swift accountability. There needs to be rapid response in these incidents we cant put this into a bureaucratic process where I get an answer in eight weeks or 10 weeks, Rep. Steve Lynch, D-Mass., told Secret Service Director Joseph Clancy. The vast majority of the private sector in the United States works this way, but it seems that the federal government without an exemption that the Secret Service does not have does not. attorneys who specialize in federal labor law say Secret Service employees, after their first three years of probation, are part of the competitive civil service and guaranteed a series of due-process rights that the agency cannot simply ignore. Although other agencies are exempt from that system, legislation making that change for the Secret Service has not materialized. So, heres a quandary for Congress: there is an agency charged with protecting the president and his family at all costs, there have been appalling breaches in the ability to successfully execute that task of late, and no one will lose his or her job just yet because there is an entire due process protocol that must be followed because Secret Service agents are federal employees, and they havent gotten through it yet. In order to change this, and exempt the agency from those particular labor laws (as has happened in other security related departments and agencies), Congress must pass legislation to change the law. Otherwise, the directors hands are tied, and all the hearings in the world will not change that. In last weeks hearing where Secret Service Director Joseph Clancy was grilled as to what in the heck is going on within a department he was brought in to clean up, Rep. Jon Mica (R-FL) sympathized with him. Well, hell, you dont have the ability to command, because your hands are tied by Title 5, Mica said during Tuesdays hearing, referring to the law that lays out the competitive service protections. You cant hire and fire. You have to go through this layer. I chaired the Civil Service subcommittee, he said, And I know how difficult it is to get rid of folks, even discipline folks. Most people are just moved horizontally to some other position. So, cutting Mr. Clancy and his predecessor Julia Pierson who did request that legislation changing the Title 5 problems be produced a little slack on this would be in order. Mr. Clancy DID put the agents who ran an SUV into an active crime scene on moderated assignment and he did refer the case directly to the Department of Homeland Security Inspector General for investigation. That was the proper way to go given the circumstances. From the commentary attributed to labor specialists and lawyers, it looks like fixing the scandal issues at the Secret Service need to start with Congress, and the Foggy Bottom Theater fireworks should take a back seat to actually changing the law to give the Director the tools he needs to get the job done. If Mr. Clancy does not use those tools, then go after him. ",3
2,"Scientists Have Simulated Time Travel With Photons... quantum particle travels through a wormhole back in time and returns to the same location in space and time / Martin Ringbauer Looks like time travel is possible for particles of light. Using a photon, physicists have managed to simulate quantum particles traveling through time. Studying the photons behavior could help scientists understand some inexplicable aspects of modern physics. The question of time travel features at the interface between two of our most successful yet incompatible physical theories Einsteins general relativity and quantum mechanics, University of Queenslands Martin Ringbauer says in a news release:. Time slows down or speeds up depending on how fast you move relative to another object. Einsteins theory suggests the possibility of traveling backwards in time by following a space-time path that returns to the starting point in space but at an earlier time. This is called a closed timelike curve (pictured above). Its a traversable wormhole. In a quantum regime, the authors say, the paradox of time travel can be resolved, leaving closed timelike curves consistent with relativity. Near a black hole, for example, the extreme effects of general relativity play a role. Pictured above, a space-time structure exhibiting closed paths in space (horizontal) and time (vertical). A quantum particle travels through a wormhole back in time and returns to the same location in space and time. These include the violation of Heisenbergs uncertainty principle, cracking of quantum cryptography, and perfect cloning of quantum states. The work was published in Nature Communications this week.

2,"[Video] The Mystery of 9-11, Dr. Graham, and Jamal Khan An intriguing mystery indeed, so I did a little research. . Local Terrorist Whistle-Blower Dead After Poisoning Dr. Grahams Obituary read in part: SHREVEPORT, LA Dr. David Graham was born in Shreveport, LA. He was born May 21, 1939 and passed away Sunday, September 17, 2006 in Shreveport, LA following a lengthy illness. Dr. Graham was 67. The other part of this tale is Jamal Khan. When Mohammad Jamal Khan pleaded guilty to trying to evade the requirement that large cash transactions be reported to banks and the government, federal prosecutors added an unusual caveat to his plea agreement: There would be no immunity from possible prosecution in the future for crimes relating to Sept. 11. The agreement adds: The U.S. Attorney is simply not aware of the involvement by the defendant in these crimes at this time. What is interesting to me is that the FBI never disputed the possibility that Dr. Grahams meetings and suspicions about the 9-11 hijackers were true. Or that they were hosted by Jamal Khan. They only disputed Dr. Grahams timeline of when he actually reported the meetings to the FBI. And by adding that little tidbit to Jamal Khans plea bargain it appears that the FBI was very interested in Jamal Khans possible involvement with the planning of the 9-11 attacks. And what has happened to the apparent money launderer and gracious host to hijackers, the mysterious Pakistani Jamal Khan? Is he in the Witness Protection Program? Did the CIA quietly ship him off for questioning? Did he really skip the country and go underground? And, if so, why did the FBI let this man covered with the bloody fingerprints of 9-11 slip away? Now over a decade later Khan is still missing and the mystery remains unsolved. DFV ended his intriguing mystery story with these words: And since Jonah Goldberg (National Review online) first highlighted this story by asking Whatever happened to the anthrax investigation (yeah, whatever DID happen to that???)one final question: Just how many subplots, sub plotters, co-conspirators, accomplices, go-betweens, money men, facilitators, collaborators, and confederates had a hand in the 9/11 attacks. and how many of those still lurk stealthily somewhere in the catacombs of international intrigue? Doctor Grahams murder remains unsolved and uninvestigated to this day and this may very well be a mystery that is never solved. You can now read his unpublished book The 9/11 Graham Report online and decide for yourself if his story rings true. ",3

3," A new study shows that biofuels which are manufactured from leftover materials of harvested corn are worse than gasoline in causing harmful atmospheric emissions in the short term, a finding that challenges the government's assertions that they are a much cleaner alternative to help combat climate change. According to E&E; Publishing, using corn cobs and stover to manufacture cellulose biofuels actually increases emissions from the plant matter and other residue components being burned at biorefineries around the country, rather than being mixed into the soil and remaining trapped as organic soil matter, said researchers from the University of Nebraska-Lincoln. 'If the residue had not been removed, some of it would be left in the field and be naturally added to maintain soil carbon,' said Adam Liska, lead author of the paper and assistant professor of biological systems engineering at the University of Nebraska. The Associated Press further noted: A $500,000 study paid for by the federal government and released [ April 20 ] in the peer-reviewed journal Nature Climate Change concludes that biofuels made with corn residue release 7 percent more greenhouse gases in the early years compared with conventional gasoline. While biofuels are better in the long run, the study says they won't meet a standard set in a 2007 energy law to qualify as renewable fuel. Wisconsin, Minnesota carry more carbon losses' Reports said that researchers used a computer model to estimate emissions across the nation's so-called Corn Belt, which consists of about 128 million acres (or about 96.8 million football fields). A removal rate of about 2.68 metric tons per acre per year over five to 10 years may decrease soil organic carbon by some 200 pounds per acre per year. 'This can add an average of 50 to 70 grams of CO2 per megajoule of biofuel. At the high end, this makes these biofuels emit about 7 percent more carbon dioxide than gasoline, making them slightly worse from a climate perspective. Over 10 years, it would reduce gasoline emissions by about 15 percent,' E&E; reported. Researchers said that Wisconsin and Minnesota were found to carry higher carbon losses. They estimate that the cold weather in these states may slow the release of soil organic carbon into the atmosphere. Liska says that the higher corn yields in these states can add larger amounts of carbon to the soil, which then represents a larger loss if corn residue is collected. The AP reported that the study's findings are bad news for what are known as cellulosic biofuels, which have received more than $1 billion in federal subsidies and support but have nevertheless struggled to meet volume targets mandated by law. Some 50 percent of the initial market in cellulosics is estimated to be derived from corn residue. Biofuel industry officials, as well as those within the Obama administration, immediately rebuked the findings and said the research was flawed. Douglas Karlen, a research leader in the Agriculture Department's Agricultural Research Service, said, for example, that the study was too simplistic in its analysis of the loss of carbon from soil, which he says can vary from field to field. Researchers also vastly overestimated how much residue farmers actually remove once the market is up and running. 'I knew this research would be contentious' And, adds Jan Koninckx, the global business director for biorefineries at DuPont: 'The core analysis depicts an extreme scenario that no responsible farmer or business would ever employ because it would ruin both the land and the long-term supply of feedstock. It makes no agronomic or business sense.' Later in the year, DuPont is scheduled to complete construction on a facility estimated to cost in excess of $200 million in Nevada, Iowa, that is expected to produce some 30 million gallons of cellulosic ethanol using corn residue from local farms. A DuPont-financed assessment said the ethanol it will make at the facility could be 100 percent better than gasoline in terms of greenhouse gas emissions. 'I knew this research would be contentious,' said Liska. 'I'm amazed it has not come out more solidly until now.' One other aspect of using ethanol-laced fuel instead of 100 percent fossil fuel: The ethanol-laced fuel gets worse mileage per gallon, so more of it must be produced and burned to go the same number of miles.

3," Yokohama Tire, the North American subsidiary of Yokohama Rubber Co. Ltd., has introduced a new tire that replaces much of its petroleum with oil derived from orange peels instead. 'The eco-focused dB Super E-spec mixes sustainable orange oil and natural rubber to drastically cut the use of petroleum, without compromising performance,' said Dan King, the company's vice president of sales. 'It also helps consumers save money at the gas pump by improving fuel efficiency via a 20-percent reduction in rolling resistance.' The tire, known by the moniker Super E-spec, is made from vulcanized rubber just like other tires. While most vulcanized rubber tires use petroleum combined with natural rubber, the Super E-spec has replaced 80 percent of its petroleum use with orange oil. The oil is extracted from what Yokohama calls a 'no-emission factory' and acquires orange peels from an orange juice factory next door. The Super E-spec has already been introduced into Yokohama's line of racing tires and is now used exclusively at the Porsche GT3 Cup race 'Patron GT3 Challenge.' It has been used in both short and 24-hour races. 'The idea of combining oil from orange peels with natural rubber was conceived by our racing engineers,' said director of corporate strategy and planning Mark Chung. 'The tire has been tested in racing applications to see what the true limitations are. The level of technology has matured to where we offer it for the passenger car lineup.' Initially, the Super E-spec will be offered in 15- and 16-inch diameters for hybrid vehicles such as the Toyota Prius. Toyota Camry hybrid, Honda Civic hybrid and Honda Accord hybrid, as well as some non-hybrid cars including the Nissan Versa, Volkswagen Golf and natural gas-powered GX. Eventually, the tires will be offered in other sizes for both cars and sport-utility vehicles. The company has not released information on how the ecological impact of disposing of the Super E-spec compares with disposing of other tires.

3," Tens of millions of Americans are obese, and while figures have stabilized in recent years according to government findings , the numbers are still staggering. Poor dietary choices rank high as a cause of obesity, but another factor -- and in my view, one that gets far less attention -- is Americans' increasing lack of physical activity. In fact, a new study found that the average obese woman only gets one hour of vigorous exercise per year , while men don't get much more -- less than four per year. The findings, published in the journal Mayo Clinic Proceedings , stem from the tracking of participants' movements over the course of a year. Researchers collected data regarding the amount of exercise participants engaged in and at what intensity level(s). Researchers defined vigorous exercise as jogging or other high-cardio-related, fat-burning exercises. For those who were considered extremely overweight, walking may be considered vigorous. For women especially, researchers cited extremely busy lives as a major reason why they exercised so little. Between work, caring for children and sleep, they noted, women did not have much time in the day to devote to fitness. 'They're living their lives from one chair to another,' Edward Archer, a research fellow with the Nutrition Obesity Research Center, told HealthDay . 'We didn't realize we were that sedentary. There are some people who are vigorously active, but it's offset by the huge number of individuals who are inactive.' Getting started in a fitness program Granted, finding the time to work in a fitness program is difficult in today's busy world. But almost everyone has time for some sort of activity 3-4 times per week, if they really want to change their lifestyle. So, the next hurdle to overcome is actually finding a fitness program that you can stick with . Most people who begin a fitness program don't stick with it, most often because it isn't the right program for them. So I asked a group of fitness experts what they would recommend for someone just beginning a fitness program: -- Gauge yourself. J. Anderson, certified personal trainer, selfnews contributor and founder/editor of Always Active Athletics , says to take some photos of yourself before you start your program and do some fitness tests, to see where you're at physically. 'If you are having a down day' after you begin a program, 'you can look at old photographs or re-take your fitness tests to see just how far you have really come.' Motivation . -- Don't attempt too much at first. Ainslie MacEachran, a certified personal trainer and cycling coach with Gemini Training Systems , located in Fort Collins, Colo., says you should set small goals initially. 'Break up your goals into little bit size pieces. Instead of trying to do it all at once, make little goals along the way that work towards your ultimate end goal,' she told me. -- Don't go it alone. Get a friend to start a program with you, says expert fitness trainer and former collegiate gymnastics star Kari Pearce of Innovative Fitness Trainers . 'Exercising with someone else often makes it more enjoyable and you will want to push yourself harder,' she told selfnews . -- Pick something fun. Kim Evans, a professional fitness coach at Wello in Grand Haven, Mich., says the dance-exercise Zumba might be a good fit for a beginner, mostly because the classes are inviting, not intimidating. 'That is a huge deal,' she told me, because 'many classes can be intimidating for the new exerciser.' Dr. Kim Chronister, a clinical psychologist and author of the book The Psychology Behind Fitness Motivation , agrees. She said in an email that a great way to get 'motivated is by finding fun activities to get into (i.e. dancing salsa for one hour or playing water polo for an hour).' -- Get in the right mindset. In order to stick with any program, you have to decide that it is for the long haul. 'When you take the time to transform your thoughts, beliefs and patterns, making lasting change is easy and effortless,' Michelle Hastie, of Total Body Health Solutions , said. -- Don't make excuses. It's easy to blow off your exercise session by convincing yourself that you don't have time today or something else 'came up,' says Josh Greene, who has a bachelor's degree in in Kinesiology from Indiana University and is currently a personal trainer at Anytime Fitness in Indianapolis. 'It takes as little as 20-30 minutes for someone to do a vigorous workout. And doing that 2-3 times per week is much more beneficial than someone doing absolutely nothing,' he told selfnews .

3," Tweet (NewsTarget) A lot of people are realizing the importance of upgrading their diets, but sometimes it's the change part where people get a little stuck. If that's what is going on with you, why not start adding green smoothies to your diet as a first (or second) step in the right direction. Greens are important blood builders and detoxifiers. They're also vitamin and mineral dense, but let's face it: most people don't eat anywhere near enough of them. Green smoothies are an easy and delicious way to change that. Bananas are often at the base of green smoothies, and if they're peeled and frozen first, they can add an ice cream like consistency. Of course, you can also add whatever other fruit you like. Apples, pineapple, Mexican (but not Hawaiian) papaya, watermelon, strawberries and grapes are all good options. Then, just add a cup or so of greens like spinach, parsley, or stemmed dinosaur kale, water, and a little of a natural sweetener. Then, blend and you're all set. A little stevia or organic honey can go a long way in making your green smoothies taste more like a dessert than a health food drink too. Many people find that adding green smoothies to their daily routine also boosts their energy levels - without coffee. Plus, it's an easy, delicious way to upgrade your diet - without even trying very hard. Greens are also chock full of chlorophyll, which helps us rebuild our blood, and it goes without saying that healthy blood is critical to healthy people. Clean and healthy blood also seems to add a vibrancy to people - so if you or your life is feeling a little dull, it's one way to start addressing a root cause of the problem. You can also power up your green smoothies with other super foods, like maca or the insides of a fresh aloe vera leaf. But, for taste and simplicity reasons, if you're just getting started on the health kick, it might be better to start slowly and add in more later, after you're already in the routine. Along with other fruit, or maybe soaked nuts, green smoothies make a great breakfast.

Cleaning Up! offers deep cleansing and using methods in this book, people have gotten rid of dozens of different types of health problems, as well as just losing excess weight, thinking more clearly, and feeling better. Kim's next book chronicles events in her life that happen to match patterns in the Bible. She's also found three places in the Bible that tell us its about these patterns and even asking you to match them. Here's a little from the upcoming book... In Isaiah 22:20, it says, 'And it must occur in that day that I will call my servant, namely Elia kim .' But, because these prophecies are cryptic and they aren't meant to be understood until they are understood, it's only the last three letters. A few lines later, it says, 'From the land of Kittim it has been revealed to them.' Here, you just take out any three middle letters, and again, it's the name of the person bringing you this message, or the sacred secret of the prophecy. Actually, if you take those two passages, Kim is about the only name you can get from both of them. In Numbers 1:1 1:18, it's talking about 'the family' and mentions Pagiel. It also twice mentions February 1st, (Kim's birthday) and then says that the youngest is 20 years old. Kim's little sister Paige is currently 20 years old. In Chronicles 1 11:20 it mentions the brother of Joab and then in the same sentence uses the word brandishing. Kim's middle name is Jo and her older sister's name is Brandi. There are other patterns to her sisters too but these sort of mention them by name. Of course, it helps if you know that there is a magical spiritual reality available that comes deep cleansing and often major dietary upgrades. It's also why Jesus was teaching the same thing, if you find his teachings in the Essene Gospel of Peace. In this text, he even says things like, 'You'll never see the father unless you clean your colon.' But, this is paraphrased... In the Bible Jesus says things more like, happy are those who wash their robes, as they can enter the tree of life. The tree of life is elsewhere explained as God's paradise. He also said, first clean the inside of the cup and then the outside will also be clean. Kim's book Cleaning Up! is here http://www.cleaningupcleanse.com .

3," Once again the corporate-owned, Left-wing mainstream media is serving as a Praetorian guard for President Barack Hussein Obama. In recent days The New York Times covered a rare visit by Obama to the National Counterterrorism Center, in which the paper initially published some very embarrassing comments the selfie-obsessed president made, but then memory-holed them later. As noted by The Federalist , the original story, written by reporters Peter Baker and Gardiner Harris and published Dec. 17, contained a stunning admission by the president following the recent terrorist attacks in Paris and San Bernardino, Calif. But by the next day Dec. 18 the embarrassing passage was removed. In a Twitter post, CNN 's Brian Stelter included the quote : In his meeting with the columnists, Mr. Obama indicated that he did not see enough cable television to fully appreciate the anxiety after the attacks in Paris and San Bernardino, and made clear that he plans to step up his public arguments. Republicans were telling Americans that he is not doing anything when he is doing a lot, he said. The first New York Times version confirmed a version of Obama that his critics have long suspected that when it comes to issues of national security , this president is an out-of-touch and disinterested bystander. 'Obama critics immediately pounced on the stunning admission from the president, expressing shock that he would claim that a lack of TV time was the real reason for him not understanding Americans' anxiety about terrorism,' The Federalist reported. Pathetic But then, The Times went into protection mode and removed the offending passage from its online version of the story, and that drew the attention of other journalists and Times watchers, who questioned the deletion. That wasn't all The Times did to protect Obama, however. In addition to deleting the embarrassing section, as tracked by Newsdiffs.org , Times editors changed the piece's headline on four separate occasions, each time putting Obama in a better light or portraying Republicans in a worse light. As reported by The Federalist : The original headline when the story was first published was 'Obama Visiting National Counterterrorism Center.' Less than two hours later, the headline was 'Obama, at Counterterrorism Center, Offers Assurances On Safety.' Then the headline was changed to 'Frustrated by Republican Critics, Obama Defends Muted Response to Attacks.' Two hours later, the headline was once again revised to 'Under Fire From G.O.P., Obama Defends Response to Terror Attacks.' The most recent headline revision, which accompanied the deletion of the passage where Obama admitted he didn't understand the American public's anxiety about terrorism, now reads, 'Assailed by G.O.P., Obama Defends His Response To Terror Attacks.' What's even more comical and pathetic is The Times ' reporters 'explanation' of what editors did, a sort of 'nothing to see here, just move on' response. Changes made no sense In a statement to the Washington Examiner 's T. Beckett Adams they responded: Thanks for the question. There's nothing unusual here. That paragraph, near the bottom of the story, was trimmed for space in the print paper by a copy editor in New York late last night. But it was in our story on the web all day and read by many thousands of readers. Web stories without length constraints are routinely edited for print. Sure. Why all the headline changes, then? Crickets. Silence. No response. As noted by Sean Davis of The Federalist , however, the changes made no sense. ' NYT says it 'trimmed' the Obama quote for space. It deleted 66 words and added 116 in that revision,' he said in one tweet. 'The NYT's excuse that it was just 'trimming for space' makes no sense. Its revision of that section added 50 words,' he said in another. The Times has been in the tank for Obama since he got the Democratic presidential nomination in 2008. To expect the paper to now change the way it has protected him is ludicrous. But every time it does, the paper needs to be exposed for doing so.

3," Although prescription drug abuse among both children and adults now rivals illegal street drugs in both prevalence and lethality, most parents are not particularly concerned about such abuse among children and teenagers, according to the most recent University of Michigan Mott Children's Hospital National Poll on Children's Health. In addition, parental support is weak for many proposed policies that could help restrict access to commonly abused narcotic painkillers like Oxcycontin or Vicodin. 'This is a national problem and a growing problem,' researcher Sarah J. Clark said. 'The results of this poll are a signal that parents may not be aware of the significant rates of misuse of narcotic pain medicine, which highlights the tremendous challenge of addressing this national problem.' Only 35 percent of parents said that they were 'very concerned' about the misuse of narcotic painkillers (opioids) by children and teenagers in their own communities. Even fewer - 19 percent - were very concerned about the misuse of such drugs in their own families. Strikingly, white parents had the lowest rates of concern (13 percent) about abuse in their families, compared with Hispanic (26 percent) or black (38 percent parents), even though painkiller abuse is three times higher among white teenagers than among black or Hispanic teenagers. White parents were also significantly less likely than black or Hispanic parents to support policies that would limit children's access to prescription painkillers. Parents underestimate seriousness of problem Recent studies have shown that more overdose deaths are caused by narcotic painkillers than by cocaine and heroin combined. Nationwide, rates of prescription drug abuse now equal or outstrip those of all illegal street drugs combined. In addition, studies have shown that 75 percent of narcotic painkiller abusers obtain the drugs from someone with a valid prescription - typically either themselves, a friend or a relative. The new poll confirmed the ease with which children and teenagers can obtain such drugs: 35 percent of parents said that they had received at least one pain drug for their children in the past five years, with half of these being narcotics. 66 percent of parents had received a prescription painkiller for at least one household adult in the past five years. Yet, nearly 50 percent of parents surveyed said they did not support requirements that people return unused pain drugs to a doctor or pharmacy, and 59 percent did not favor a requirement that painkiller prescription refills be obtained only from a doctor's office. 66 percent of parents did support laws that would require parents to show identification before purchasing a narcotic painkiller for a child, while 57 percent supported regulations prohibiting people from obtaining a narcotic painkiller prescription from more than one doctor. But in general, the researchers noted, the parental responses indicated a low level of concern about the problem. 'Recent estimates are that one in four high school seniors have ever used a narcotic pain medicine. However, parents may downplay the risks of narcotic pain medicine because they are prescribed by a doctor,' Clark said.

3," Tweet (NewsTarget) Malnutrition shaves as much as three percent off the production of some of the poorest countries in the world, but obesity could soon affect economic output as severely as malnutrition, according to findings from the World Bank as of this week. The World Health Organization (WHO) estimates that obesity has tripled in the past twenty years and in addition, 10 percent of children and 20 percent of adults will be obese in Europe and Central Asia by the year 2010 unless some kind of action is taken. Dr. Meera Shekar -- senior nutrition specialist with the World Bank -- said that malnutrition cuts two to three percent off of the gross domestic product (GDP) in the hardest-hit countries -- and the growing rate of obesity could do the same. Dr. Shekar says 'We suspect that these estimates will be just as high' for obesity. Six percent of health costs in the WHO's European region already comes from obesity in adults. For example, obesity cost France $6.41 billion in direct costs alone in 2002, while cost the state of California $22 billion in the year 2000, including indirect costs. As obesity is also expected to reduce life expectancy, it could have a direct impact on the global economy as well. A recent study in Britain forecasted that men would live five years less by 2050 if current trends were not reversed regarding the global obesity problem. Dr. Shekar said, 'The important thing is that because the problem is increasing we would see an increasing drain on economies, particularly developing economies,' while adding that obesity had appeared recently in the Middle East and North Africa -- and was turning out to be a big problem in Latin America. The prevalence of obesity seems to shift to the poor from the rich in developing countries -- and this has happened in France, where obesity is five times more prevalent among low-income groups than high earners according to WHO Regional Adviser Dr. Franceso Branca. ### ",4
3," Days ago it was announced that European researchers had discovered a breakthrough cure for grey and thinning hair: A topical application of a sun-activated compound called PC-KUS (a modified pseudocatalase). However, the researchers may be a few hundred years late with their discovery since onion juice has been used as a remedy for thin and greying hair for ages. What the researchers found was that grey hair is primarily caused by a buildup of hydrogen peroxide at the root of hair follicles and that this was due in great part to a reduction in the natural antioxidant compound catalase. In addition to helping cleanse the scalp and follicles, onion juice also promotes the production of catalase. Catalase prevents grey hair as well as promoted thicker hair follicles. The researchers 'new' breakthrough appears to be the rediscovery of a remedy for grey hair and baldness that herbalists have known for centuries: Onion juice. Hundreds of years ago, famed herbalist John Gerard (1545- 1612) wrote: 'the juyce of onions annointed upon a bald head in the sun bringeth the hair againe very speedily.' Today, many herbalists recommend onion juice either singly or in combination with other natural items as a remedy for grey and thinning hair. What the research found The new research, which was published in The FASB Journal , also found that the modified catalase compound also works for the skin condition vitiligo (a skin pigment condition marked by loss of skin color). Reported study author Karin U. Schallreuter, M.D. from the Institute for Pigmentary Disorders : 'To date, it is beyond any doubt that the sudden loss of the inherited skin and localized hair color can affect those individuals in many fundamental ways. The improvement of quality of life after total and even partial successful repigmentation has been documented.' In 2009, a similar breakthrough for grey hair was reported which also found that hydrogen peroxide buildup was a culprit and that the compound catalase could reverse grey hair. That research was conducted by Bradford University in the UK. Other natural solutions for grey hair Over the years, many remedies for grey hair have been used with mixed results. Some of the better known ones include: The oriental remedy fo-ti has a long history of being used for grey hair. Fo-ti is also called he shou wu, which translates to 'black-haired Mr. He' or 'Mr. He's black hair'. Black Strap molasses has worked well for many people for restoration of color, but it may take some time (as is true with other remedies as well). Pine needle tea is another remedy which has been used to help with greying hair. Many have reported that moringa leaf and moringa root extracts have restored hair color as well as helped with thinning hair. Nutrition for hair health As is true for the entire body, good nutrition is essential for healthy hair. The best diet for hair health is a wholesome diet which is rich in silica, B-vitamins, omega-3s, protein, calcium and iron. Other important nutrients include antioxidants, trace minerals and vitamin A. Some of the best foods for hair health include: Oats Sweet rice and mochi (pounded sweet rice) Nuts and seeds Leafy, green vegetables Root vegetables, such as carrots, rutabagas, parsnips, ginger, turnips, and onions Winter squash Black beans Pumpkin Black pepper Brown rice syrup Seaweed Microalgae Foods to avoid for better hair health: Cold foods and drinks Sugary foods and drinks Fatty foods Animal protein Tofu Salt Dairy products ",1
3," According to a report released on June 18, 2013, special accommodations for pregnant women are often met with firm opposition from employers. It happened back in 2007 when a then 18-year old pregnant woman named Heather Myers was fired from her Walmart job for drinking water from a bottle. Even though she was clearly pregnant and according to her worker orientation meeting, drinking on the job, providing it is water, is acceptable for employees. However, in this case, the supervisor changed the rule and said that drinking water during work required a doctor's note. Myers, intending to comply with the new rule, got the doctor's note as requested. But then a new rule came into effect by the supervisor which stated that only fountain water was acceptable and that drinking from a water bottle was not. Urinary tract infections are common during pregnancy and other reasons aside, require more need for hydration for the expected mother At this time Myers had a urinary tract infection which required her to drink water more frequently. Her ultimatum was to either not hydrate (unless by fountain) or leave. She left and sued. In general, some places of business offer more courtesies to pregnant workers. For example, they are allowed to take more frequent bathroom breaks, and are able to sit at posts where they might normally stand. On top of that, they are allowed, as they should be, to drink water more often. Why is hydration important during pregnancy? Since human blood is made up primarily by the water that we consume and since the volume of blood is to increase by as much as 40 percent during pregnancy, regular and extra water intake is necessary. The fluid, when pregnant or not, is responsible for carrying nutrients to cells and taking toxins away. Other factors: The one quart or so of amniotic fluid surrounding the baby needs to be replaced every few hours Proper hydration regulates body temperature Dehydration can trigger uterine contractions, leading to premature labor The bottom line is that proper hydration is required to maintain a healthy pregnancy.

3," Tweet (NewsTarget) Is it conceivable that massage can provide more effective relief from low back pain than medication? A new study published in the Annals of Internal Medicine suggests this therapy might indeed alleviate back pain better in the short term than traditional interventions of medicine, bed rest or exercise: Healthday reports. The investigation conducted by the Group Health Research Institute in Seattle involved 400 patients who had low back pain, the majority of which were middle aged, Caucasian and female. Researchers found those who were given a series of relaxation massage or structural massage were better able to work and be active than those who were given traditional medical care, such as pain pills, muscle relaxants or physical therapy. According to The New York Times , the study's participants were randomly divided into three groups: structural massage, relaxation massage and traditional care. Patients in the massage groups received one hour of therapy weekly for 10 weeks. At the conclusion of the 10 week period, over one-third of the patients who were given massage therapy reported their pain was much improved or eliminated completely, as opposed to only one in 25 patients who were given traditional care. Furthermore, patients in the massage groups were twice as likely to have spent fewer days in bed rest, used less pain pills and participated in more activity than the traditional care group. Lead author Daniel Cherkin was surprised by the fact that structural massage did not prove superior to relaxation massage in relieving pain. Structural massage involves manipulating specific back pain related muscles and ligaments, while relaxation massage, otherwise known as Swedish massage, involves inducing body-wide relaxation. The beneficial effects of the massage seemed not only to be experienced during the 10-week therapy period, but also to linger for a time following the cessation of therapy. Evidence of this lingering effect was manifested by the fact that the massage groups continued to display improved function six months after the study's onset. At the one year mark, however, no significant differences were found in the three groups. Although the researchers were uncertain of massage therapy's exact mechanism of action for easing back pain , they voiced several theories. One suggestion was that it either stimulated tissue locally or produced a general central nervous system response. Another speculation was that merely spending time in a relaxing environment and feeling cared for might have been responsible for the improvement. An additional factor to consider is the subjectivity that is impossible to eliminate in such studies. Patients in the control group were aware that the other groups were receiving massage and this knowledge may have caused them to discount their own progress. It should be reiterated that the study suggests rather than proves the benefit of massage for back pain . Also, some members of the American medical community not associated with the research have expressed reluctance to accept the suggested benefits as being valid. Conversely, the study's authors offered their assessments of its import. Cherkin characterizes the results as being 'pretty strong.' He states the massage was tested on patients who did not improve using the standard medical approach to back pain treatment. He feels that massage therapy is a reasonable thing to try for anyone getting insufficient relief from this malady. The coauthor, Dr. Richard Deyo, feels that massage appears to provide clinicians with another choice for managing the challenging medical problem of chronic low back pain . http://health.usnews.com/health-news/family-... http://well.blogs.nytimes.com/2011/07/04/emb... http://abcnews.go.com/Health/PainManagement/...

3," New research in the August 1 issue of Cancer reveals that men diagnosed with prostate cancer tend to rush into their decision on treatment, as well as make those decisions based on inaccurate beliefs about the disease. Conventional medicine generally offers four treatment options for prostate cancer patients: removal of the prostate gland; 'seeding' the cancer with radioactive material; externally radiation; or cryptotherapy, which freezes the tumor. Researchers conducted in-depth interviews with 20 newly diagnosed prostate cancer patients after treatment options had been explained by a urologist. They discovered that 19 of the 20 patients chose a course of treatment based partly on the experiences of a friend or relative who'd had the disease. The study's lead author, Dr. Thomas D. Denberg, stressed that prostate cancer patients should avoid comparing their own cancer experience the experiences of others. 'Because Uncle Fred did well with a certain procedure doesn't mean that you will,' Denberg said. Though all the patients in the study said they understood that the cancer progressed slowly, 12 patients wanted treatment as soon as possible, eight of which believed that surgery was the best option. Patients also made treatment decisions based on the misconceptions that a cure was guaranteed if the tumor was confined to the prostate, and that the chance of being cured was still high even if the tumor spread beyond the prostate. Researchers also found that the men who had decided on surgery rejected the other options, and the men who opted for radiation therapy preferred seeding over external radiation, citing efficacy and possible negative side effects. The study's authors say that men should not rush into a treatment decision, and should educate themselves on the disease to avoid common misperceptions. Proponents of alternative cancer treatments say that men should also look into safe, natural treatments for prostate cancer, including vitamin D from sunlight, green tea and the minerals selenium and zinc. Pomegranate juice has recently been discovered to markedly slow the growth of prostate cancer tumors. ### ",4
3," Middle-age-spread is a real issue for both men and women who step into their 40s. As the metabolism slows down with age, and the muscle mass is reduced as well, it's increasingly difficult for the body to burn fat and stay fit. Although some handle it better than others, middle age is far from a breezy walk through the park for most people. Under these stressful circumstances, some people find comfort in food or alcohol, both of which also tend to show around the waist. But it's not all hopeless for those trying to fight the dreaded middle-age-spread. According to a new study of large proportions published in the journal BMJ , a minor change in diet can actually help you stay slim throughout your 40s. Here's how. The BMJ study on flavonoids and weight changes The BMJ study was the largest of its kind so far. It involved more than 124,000 middle aged and older people, who self-reported their weight once every two years, and their diet once every four years. The researchers analyzed this data over 24 years and, after adjusting for smoking and fitness activities, discovered that people who ate more flavonoid-rich foods maintained their weight better or even lost a few pounds. Flavonoids are natural compounds found in plants, where they perform a number of important roles. For instance, they are responsible for the proper communication between plant cells, as well as for creating attractive colors for bees and butterflies, which can help with pollination. Some flavonoid-heavy foods are strawberries, bananas, grapes, pears, onions, prunes, peppers, green tea and many others, but also chocolate and wine. It seems that with human beings, flavonoids might prevent unwanted weight gain. While most adults between 18 and 49 tend to gain one or two pounds every year, those involved in the study who adhered to a flavonoid-rich diet gained an average of 0.16 to 0.23 fewer pounds every four years. Berries showed the best results Different foods contain different types of flavonoids. The flavonoids that showed the best results in relation to weight gain were the anthocyanin, which can be found in strawberries, blackberries, blueberries , cherries, grapes, radishes and blackcurrants. Flavonoid polymers found in apples and green tea also showed promising results, as did the flavonols commonly found in tea and onions . While the results of the study might not seem impressive to those looking to lose weight fast, they are nevertheless extremely promising for people dreading the middle-age-spread. For them, it was outstanding news that something as simple as eating a handful of their favorite berries can help them maintain their weight throughout their 40s. <='' h1=''>The study published in the journal BMJ was only observational, but its authors had more in mind than the weight of the participants. As it is today, most Americans don't even eat one cup of fruit or two cups of veggies per day. By showing that some fruits like berries can be linked to weight loss, the researchers hoped to encourage people to eat more fruit overall. What's more, earlier studies on flavonoids indicated potential health benefits other than maintaining a desirable weight. Indeed, flavonoid-rich foods were shown to increase energy expenditure and therefore decrease fat absorption, while also working as efficient anti-inflammatories. The intake of flavonoids has been associated with a decreased risk of certain cancers, as well as with the support of the cardiovascular and nervous systems. At the end of the day, you just can't go wrong by eating a few more of your favorite berries. Not only will they help you maintain your desired weight through middle age, but they're also likely to help you fight a score of other life-threatening diseases.

3," The Obama Administration could not build a functional health insurance exchange website despite spending a mind-boggling $2.1 billion of taxpayer money, but now feels it is capable of essentially managing the entire Internet. On February 26, a small group of unelected, unaccountable bureaucrats -- three, to be exact -- voted to give the federal government the instant authority to reclassify the Internet from a free, uninhibited mode of communication and commerce into a 'public utility' the same as your old phone company, so it can now be 'better regulated' -- and all under the phony guise of making everything more 'fair.' Now, when Comcast or Verizon provide services to your home, they will have to do so 'in the public interest,' whatever that means. In a partisan move, the Federal Communications Commission's two Democrat members and its Democrat chairman voted to approve the new reclassification and associated rules over the objections of the panel's two Republican members. As Fox News and other media reported, the rules remained secret right up to the vote, though one member, Republican Ajit Pai, tried to sound the alarm about the bogus nature of the plan -- and against FCC panel rules -- in the days before the vote . Nothing is broken In an interview with Reason magazine online, Pai called the so-called 'Net Neutrality' rules a 'solution that won't work to a problem that doesn't exist.' 'Nowhere in the 332-page document that I've received will anyone find the FCC detailing any kind of systemic harm to consumers, and it seems to me that should be the predicate for certainly any kind of preemptive regulation--some kind of systemic problem that requires an industry-wide solution,' Pai said. 'That simply isn't here.' A report by Investor's Business Daily noted that the FCC has been down this road before, and has been slapped by the federal court which hears regulatory cases: Neutrality rules have barred ISPs from blocking or purposely slowing down Internet traffic. But a Washington, D.C., Court of Appeals ruling in January 2014 gutted much of the FCC's authority. It's not clear how the court would view the new rules, but what is certain is that the big telecoms are sure to challenge them. Still, the public remains largely unaware of the scope of the new rules and just what Net Neutrality is. As some media have reported, grassroots support is high, but that's odd because, as Ars Technica pointed out, with the exception of the FCC commissioners, no one knows what the rules actually say. 'The full net neutrality order has not been published yet,' the website noted. 'A solution that won't work' There is also substantial criticism over the issue of President Obama interfering with the function of what is supposed to be an independent commission. 'Let me start by issuing apologies. First, I am just sick about what Chairman Wheeler was forced to go through during this process. It was disgraceful to have the Administration overtake the commission's rulemaking process and dictate an outcome for pure political purposes,' wrote Republican Commissioner Michael O'Rielly, in a dissent. 'It is so disturbing to know that those efforts were about illegitimately pushing a larger political cause mostly unrelated to technology. This administration went so far beyond what has ever been attempted, and its inappropriate interference in the commission's activities will forever change this institution,' O'Rielly added. Both of the Republican commissioners have predicted that the new Net Neutrality rules, which are scheduled to take effect in 60 days barring a legal challenge, will fail to accomplish what the administration and FCC Chairman Tom Wheeler say they will do. 'What doesn't make sense, and has never made sense, is to take a regulatory framework developed for Ma Bell in the 1930s and make her great grandchildren, with technologies and options undreamed of eighty years ago, live under it,' Jim Cicconi, AT&T;'s senior executive vice president of external and legislative affairs, told USA Today in a statement.

3," Tweet (NewsTarget) A new Israeli study has found that pomegranate juice could be a heart-healthy drink for diabetics, despite the fruit's high sugar concentration. The researchers' small human trial -- published in the August issue of the journal Atherosclerosis -- examined 10 diabetics and 10 healthy control subjects for three months, during which the diabetics were administered fresh-squeezed pomegranate juice from handpicked fruit. At the study's end, the researchers found that the juice did not affect blood sugar levels, cholesterol or triglycerides, but did significantly reduce serum lipid peroxide levels by 56 percent and thiobarbituric acid reactive substance (TBARS) levels by 28 percent. TBARS is a measure of the oxidation levels of LDL cholesterol, which can eventually lead to atherosclerosis and heart disease. The study's authors concluded that 'pomegranate juice consumption by diabetic patients did not worsen the diabetic parameters, but rather resulted in anti-oxidative effects on serum and macrophages, which could contribute to attenuation of atherosclerosis development in these patients.' Lead researcher Professor Michael Aviram says he was surprised to find that the sugars contained in pomegranate juice did not worsen diabetes parameters, such as blood sugar, as other fruit sugars do. 'In most juices, sugars are present in free -- and harmful -- forms,' says Aviram. 'In pomegranate juice, however, the sugars are attached to unique antioxidants, which actually make these sugars protective against atherosclerosis.' 'What this study clearly demonstrates is that not all sugars have the same effect on the body, as is often claimed by the processed food industry,' said Mike Adams, author of How to Halt Diabetes in 25 Days. 'Natural fruit sugars are far healthier than processed, refined sugars, even if they both have the same statistics on the nutrition facts label,' he said. 'And pomegranate juice is emerging as a natural medicine with remarkable abilities. If it were a drug instead of a fruit, drug companies would be announcing a breakthrough discovery.' Recent studies on pomegranate juice's positive effects on heart health, prostate cancer and arthritis have led to a boom in retail sales of the juice, which has seen a 300 percent sales increase in the UK since the start of 2005. ### ",4
3," Despite recent blowback from the American people over so-called 'sanctuary city' policies, in which local officials conspire against federal immigration authorities to ensure that illegal immigrants are not rounded up and deported, other cities are working to implement similar policies, all while the Obama administration looks the other way and refuses to enforce existing immigration laws. Now, according to the The Gazette , activists in Iowa are working to turn Iowa City and Cedar Rapids into sanctuaries for illegal immigrants, just days after an undocumented migrant shot and killed a 32-year-old American woman in San Francisco, perhaps the original 'sanctuary city.' The migrant, 45-year-old Francisco Sanchez, had been deported five times and was in custody as recently as March, but San Francisco authorities released him, citing the city's policy. 'We want people to be able to participate in the community without fear,' Karla Stoltzfus Detweiler, a Mennonite pastor involved in requesting that Iowa City to officially ignore the illegal status of undocumented migrants, told the paper. So much for law and order Meanwhile, in nearby Cedar Rapids, the effort is emerging out of a class struggle, according to advocate Marlon Pierre-Antoine, a Haitian-American leading the sanctuary city movement there. 'The working class cannot win the struggle against the ruling class unless it is united,' said Pierre-Antoine, 20, an organizer for SocialistAction, a group that wants a world without borders and immediate citizenship for all immigrants. If one or both Iowa cities decide to defy federal law and become sanctuary cities, they would join some 200 other U.S. cities where progressive city officials have made similar choices [see map here ]. The map was part of a recent effort by the Centers for Immigration Studies to highlight the growing number of communities that have elected to essentially place their residents at greater risk of criminal action from people who are not even supposed to be in the country. 'More than 200 cities, counties and states across the United States are considered sanctuary cities,' CIS says on its web site . 'These state and local jurisdictions have policies, laws, executive orders, or regulations allowing them to avoid cooperating with federal immigration law enforcement authorities. These 'cities' ignore federal law authorizing U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) to administratively deport illegal aliens without seeking criminal warrants or convictions from federal, state, or local courts.' What makes Iowa so important to critics of sanctuary city policies is that the state is home to the earliest of election primaries; by allowing more immigrants, illegal and otherwise, to settle there undisturbed, eventually the demographics will favor the progressive socialists. 'One could also argue that any jurisdiction that provides drivers licenses, or welfare benefits, or public housing, or municipal ID cards is a sanctuary,' Jessica Vaughan, CIS director of policy studies, said, adding that would push the number to well over 300. Following the murder in San Francisco of Kate Steinle, 32, some lawmakers are recommending or pursuing legislative options such as cutting federal funding to sanctuary cities and instituting mandatory jail terms for repeat illegal border crossers. Just say no and Texas should lead the way But in the great scheme of things, too many 'opposition' Republicans won't fight President Obama on issues like amnesty for illegal aliens, or could not muster up enough support to overcome an expected veto of legislation cutting federal funds to such cities. The only real option, then, is to treat federal law like many other states and cities are doing: Ignore it and dare the administration to try selectively enforcing them. Texas, known for its independent streak, should lead the way. The Texas Legislature and Gov. Greg Abbott should immediately nullify all federal gun laws, ignore federal laws prohibiting recreational pot use like Colorado and Washington have done, wave off federal and Supreme Court rulings like the administration does and just dare the Obama regime to step in. No doubt, this vindictive White House would try to do so Obama's Justice Department has sued 'red states' often while ignoring wrongdoing in blue 'progressive' states but Texas could and should hold firm. And who knows? Maybe other states would do the same and join in with Texas. Lawlessness should never be the first option in a country that supposedly values law and order, but when an administration becomes so selective, so vindictive and even lackadaisical with the enforcement of federal statutes to the point where it is costing Americans their lives what other choice do states have?

3," Instead of opting for potentially harmful mainstream acne medications, try safe and effective natural remedies for acne problems. You may find your acne and associated problems such as redness and light scarring completely gone or greatly improved in as little as two weeks or less. Natural Acne Remedies Lemon juice, tea-tree oil and aqueous cream Before going to bed, bathe or shower and shampoo. Next, apply lemon juice over your face (this will itch for a minute or two). Rub in a small amount of pure tea-tree oil. Then, apply a thick layer of aqueous cream to your face and leave on overnight, lying on your back if you must. Or, after about half an hour or so, rub the cream in. Help this and other remedies along by eating three kiwifruit and about 3/4 cup of raw carrots daily. Oatmeal, vinegar, raspberries, egg, sea salt Pour some oatmeal into a small bowl. Mash up some raspberries and mix them with about a teaspoon of sea salt and the oatmeal. Add about two tablespoons of vinegar and one egg and mix with a spoon until it makes a pasty mix. Wash your face with an exfoliating scrub (such as apricot scrub) or exfoliate with a loofah. Steam your face and then apply the mixture thickly. Leave on for about 30 minutes or until the mixture is somewhat dry and starts to crumble off. Rinse with cold water. Honey and cinnamon Take three tablespoons of honey and one tablespoon of cinnamon and make a paste. Put it on the affected area and apply it in circles. Leave it on while you sleep and wash it off in the morning Lemon juice, H2O2, willow bark, aloe, echinacea and goldenseal Mix in a bowl or container some lemon juice, a small amount of hydrogen peroxide, willow bark powder, echinacea and goldenseal. Mix together and use this solution as an astringent. Apply w/ cotton balls or tissue and leave it on your face to dry. Once it dries, put aloe vera on your skin. Do this twice daily after first washing your face. Fresh basil leaves Take a small handful of fresh basil leaves (available at most grocery stores). Let the leaves simmer in two cups of water for about 15 minutes and then put the mixture in the refrigerator to chill. Apply the mixture to troubled areas or your entire face with a cotton ball. Gets rid of acne and also helps with any existing scarring. Egg white Dab a little egg white on pimples and leave it on overnight or sometimes apply it all over your face or affected area. You'll likely notice results the next morning. Pimples/zits are reduced or gone, and your skin feels great. Apple cider vinegar Soak a cotton ball in cider vinegar and add salt to the cotton ball. Apply to infected area and hold there for as long as you can. This should instantly reduce the swelling. Works well for large cystic acne as well. Other natural acne remedies include: ",1
3," The multi-million dollar infertility industry offers a huge list of expensive -- and often invasive -- tests and procedures to help couples who have difficulty conceiving, such as in vitro fertilization (IVF) and intracytoplasmic sperm injection (ICSI). Unfortunately, assisted reproduction technologies (ART) can have a dark side that'srarely mentioned by the mainstream media. High tech baby making procedures are increasingly being linked to an increased risk of congenital malformations as well a greater chance for several diseases down the road ( http://www.selfnews.com/029116_infertilit... ). But now a new systematic review of research by New Zealand scientists just published in The Cochrane Library provides evidence a natural therapy could be a solution to fertility problems in many men. The study found that men who take antioxidant supplements are significantly more likely to get their partners pregnant (the regular old-fashioned non-ART way) than men who don't take the supplements. Less-than-optimal fertility, known as subfertility, affects about one in 20 men. In the new research paper, investigators in obstetrics and gynecology at the University of Auckland in New Zealand pointed out that chemicals known as reactive oxygen species (ROS) are cause damage to cells, especially sperm cells. This may explain why some men have lowered sperm counts which can interfere with their ability to fertilize eggs. But a host of antioxidants , including certain vitamins and minerals, are known to reduce the damage created by ROS. The review zeroed in on 34 trials totaling 2,876 couples undergoing assisted reproductive techniques, including in vitro fertilization and sperm injections. Most men in these studies had been found to have low sperm counts or low sperm motility. The research trials examined all involved treating the men with many different types of oral antioxidants, including vitamin E, L-carnitine, zinc and magnesium. The results showed that, compared to controls, a woman was far more likely to become pregnant if her partner took antioxidants. Other trials examined the effects of antioxidants on sperm concentration and motility and also found mostly positive improvements with antioxidant supplementation. 'When trying to conceive as part of an assisted reproductive program, it may be advisable to encourage men to take oral antioxidant supplements to improve their partners' chances of becoming pregnant,' said lead researcher Marian Showell, in a media statement. She added that the research team didn't have enough data comparing different antioxidants to reach any conclusions about which supplements may be the most effective in helping men achieve fatherhood. 'We need more head-to-comparisons to understand whether any one antioxidant is performing better than any other,' Dr. Showell said. For more information: http://www.selfnews.com/antioxidants.html ",4
3," Enzymes are extremely vital to human well-being. They play a critical role in digestion and nutrient assimilation, in immune response, cognitive acceleration and cellular detoxification, among other things. Get a wide variety of digestive enzymes to improve your digestive system. Enzymes are long-chain proteins that take on specific shapes and act like a key to unique locks throughout the body. Their job is to carry out very specific functions throughout the body. Most of the digestive enzymes are produced by the pancreas and are therefore called pancreatic enzymes. Enzymes and the digestive process: Enzymes are extremely important for breaking down carbohydrates, protein and fatty acids and preparing them for proper digestion and assimilation in the body. Individuals with digestive challenges are often unable to produce sufficient quantities of digestive enzymes and are unable to effectively digest the food that they are eating. Improper digestion causes significantly more stress and inflammation in the gut lining that ultimately leads to the degradation of the mucosal membranes and the complications of leaky gut syndrome. When the mucosal membrane is damaged, it is then unable to secrete the appropriate enzymes, and we end up with a vicious cycle that causes more gut inflammation. Symptoms of low pancreatic enzymes: ",1
3," Big Pharma has been doggedly searching for drugs that target a group of nuclear receptor proteins in the human body known by the long title of peroxisome proliferator-activated receptors (PPARs, for short). The reason? PPARs regulate the expression of genes that are involved in fat and carbohydrate metabolism, among other functions -- so the theory is that if drugs could control PPARs, the medications would treat diabetes, high cholesterol and even maybe obesity. But it turns out there's already a substance that could do all this. And it's not a side effect-laden chemical. It's a compound in grapefruit. Bottom line: there's extremely sweet breaking news about a compound hidden in the tangy flavor of grapefruits that may treat diabetes naturally and also bring some of the benefits of low carb dieting to the body, too -- without dieting. Scientists from the Hebrew University of Jerusalem and Massachusetts General Hospital (MGH), have discovered that naringenin , an antioxidant derived from the bitter flavor of grapefruits and other citrus fruits, triggers the liver to break down fat. While the function of the pancreas is important to diabetics, the liver is the main organ responsible for the regulation of carbohydrates and blood levels of fat. After a meal, the blood is flushed with sugars, which activate LXR-alpha, a PPAR associated with inflammation. This triggers the liver to create fatty acids for long-term storage. But during periods of fasting (and low carb dieting) the process is reversed, fat cells release fatty acids and break them down to ketones. There's an increased sensitivity to insulin, too. The new research, just published in the online journal PLoS ONE , shows that naringenin activates two kinds of PPARs (dubbed PPAR-alpha and PPARy) and blocks LXR-alpha -- resulting in fasting-type benefits to the body. 'It is a process which is similar to the Atkins diet, without many of the side effects,' Martin L. Yarmush, MD, PhD, director of the MGH Center for Engineering in Medicine and one of the paper's authors, said in a media statement. 'The liver behaves as if fasting, breaking down fatty acids instead of carbohydrates.' 'It is a fascinating find,' Yaakov Nahmias, PhD, the paper's senior author said in the press statement. He pointed out that the results of the research were what the pharmaceutical industry has long been seeking through drug research. 'But their (drug) development was plagued by safety concerns. Remarkably, naringenin is a dietary supplement with a clear safety record. Evidence suggests it might actually protect the liver from damage,' Dr. Nahmias added. If the results of the new study hold up in human patients, the research team believes the grapefruit compound could become a treatment for high cholesterol, type-2 diabetes, and metabolic syndrome.

3," Researchers from ATM Metabolics say they have isolated a chemical, naturally occurring in fruits and vegetables, that protects the body from the diabetes-producing effects of sugars. ATM Metabolics is a research company specializing in treatment of metabolic and neurological disorders. The researchers isolated and tested a chemical, which they call simulin, and found that it accelerated the removal of excess sugar from the bloodstream, increased the sensitivity of insulin receptors, reduced the amount of carbohydrates absorbed, and reduced the amount of glucose manufactured by the liver. It also helped '[mobilize] carbohydrates from the fat cells.' Calling simulin a 'sugar defense mechanism,' the researchers said their findings suggested the chemical helps the body deal with sugar's potentially harmful effects. If added to foods and beverages, they said, it might help protect against diabetes and even allow diabetics to eat sugary foods again. Simulin is not a sweetener, but rather a compound that could be added to already sweetened products. The researchers have speculated that the chemical evolved as a way to encourage animals to eat more fruit by protecting them against diabetes. 'Fruit plants depend on their fruits being eaten to spread, so it makes sense that they would do everything they could to keep their fruit on the menu,' said researcher Daryl Thompson. 'This could be why humans didn't become diabetic despite eating so much sugar in fruit and vegetables.' Thompson said that further studies of simulin's effects are underway to clear the way for its use as a commercial food additive. He said that because the product is natural, it should not need to receive special FDA approval, and could probably achieve Generally Recognized As Safe status. For the same reason, he expects companies and consumers to line up once the product is ready. 'We've had a good response from the food industry,' he said, 'and we think consumers will accept it because it is natural.' ",1

Agence France-Presse reports that the value of Old Media has dropped significantly in recent years, especially the traditional newspaper industry, as it has struggled to cope with the rising New Media landscape. This was epitomized recently by the sale of the San Diego Union-Tribune in early May for $85 million, AFP said, which 'underscored the horrific slump in the value of 'old media' companies' in the past several years. AFP further reported: Although the sum paid by Tribune Publishing was only marginally below the $110 million in a 2011 sale of the San Diego group and excluded some valuable real estate, the newspaper was believed to be worth as much as $1 billion as late as 2004. Revenues decline as investment dollars in digital platforms remain scarce This story is being repeated at major metro dailies all over the country. In fact, the Pew Research Center says that valuations of the Boston Globe , Philadelphia Inquirer , Minneapolis Star-Tribune , and Chicago Sun-Times are all down by more than 90 percent of their peaks. While these and other legacy papers are attempting to retain readership by offering digital subscriptions and mobile apps, such efforts appear to be too little, too late for many. For U.S. dailies over the past 10 years, weekday circulation has dropped off 17 percent. In addition, ad revenue has fallen by more than 50 percent as advertisers turn to online dailies and other media, Pew noted. The financial hemorrhaging got so bad last year for three large media companies that they opted to spin off newspapers so they could concentrate more on profitable enterprises like broadcast or digital properties. 'Every newspaper chain talks about getting digital faster. The plain truth is that despite almost two decades of effort, most aren't close to where they need to be,' Ken Doctor, an industry analyst who is the author of the Newsonomics blog and consultant for the research firm Outsell, told AFP. In short order, Doctor predicts, newspapers won't be left with many options except to cut the frequency of their print editions, as several dailies have already done. Alternatively, they might opt to go completely digital, as some have chosen to do. That latter option is easier said than done, however. Developing a user-friendly digital platform that retains some of the print version's identity is expensive, and since ad revenues for the industry have not increased since 2008, it is more difficult to invest in digital because the funds are simply not there. During the first quarter of this year, seven of the biggest newspaper groups only generated a combined profit of $21 million. In 2005, the massive Gannett group alone earned $1.8 billion. 'These companies have little to invest,' Doctor said. 'They're still paying off debt, issuing dividends, keeping up with pension obligations, and anticipating print ad results that can't find a bottom.' The red ink will continue to flow Even the legacy starship paper The New York Times , which as been one of the most aggressive in shifting to digital news, acknowledged recently that 70 percent of its income is derived from the print editions. What is the solution? Alan Mutter, a former Chicago newspaper editor who now consults on digital news, told AFP that newspaper groups should rethink their strategy and act more like startups. 'People in the media business have to recognize they're not in the print or broadcasting business, they are in the business of attracting audiences' to sell advertising, he said. Other papers are beginning to partner with huge digital brands such as Facebook, Google and other media companies that have a global reach. In the meantime, the legacy papers will continue to be printed in black ink, but it's the red ink that will ultimately spell the demise of many of them.

3," The president of the United States has his priorities mixed up. And what's more, he ought to be ashamed of himself. That isn't a Democrat or Republican criticism. It is a statement of fact regarding any American president who would allow illegal aliens the 'right' to protest on a taxpayer-bought-and-paid-for National Mall he ordered closed to American citizens - who also happen to be veterans of World War II - at the risk of being arrested by uniformed Secret Service officers in riot gear. As reported by Breitbart News over the weekend: Secret Service and police in riot gear arrived to the World War II Memorial in Washington, D.C. Sunday to monitor veterans demanding that memorials barricaded due to the government shutdown be re-opened. Though the Obama administration barricaded open-air memorials and even previously threatened to arrest World War II veterans on 'Honor Flights' to see their memorial, they allowed pro-amnesty demonstrators, including many illegal immigrants, to use the National Mall, which was supposed to be closed due to the shutdown, for a rally in support of comprehensive immigration reform. Democrats in Congress - like House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi - were allowed to ride to the event in golf carts. For this president, illegal aliens take precedence over World War II veterans Yes, that's right. Democrats like Pelosi - who thanked Obama for allowing the Mall to be opened for the rally - and Vice President Biden have nothing but praise for illegal aliens, but they aren't lifting a finger to ensure access to a memorial for fragile World War II vets who likely won't live long enough to see it again. Not all U.S. political figures and leaders are as misguided and heartless, as reported by Breitbart News : Former Alaska Gov. Sarah Palin, who addressed the veterans along with Sens. Ted Cruz (R-TX) and Mike Lee (R-UT) at the 'Million Vet March,' said that during what she said should be referred to as the 'government slim-down,' President Obama was showing not only his real priorities but a 'shameful' 'lack of valor' and 'lack of respect.' On her Facebook page , rally attendee LaDonna Hale Curzon from Virginia wrote that, prior to Palin's arrival, there was more shameful behavior on the part of federal officers and local police, who she said moved in and 'attempted to shut down the event.' She also wrote that 'two police cruisers blocked entrance into the WWII memorial, in an effort to stop truckers from arriving from the highway' and 'four marked Secret Service vehicles arrived on the scene, joining dozens of law enforcements, who had already arrived, including a SWAT team dressed in full riot gear.' All across the Internet Monday, pictures of police in riot gear, squad cars and even armored 'riot' vehicles were seen at the event. What the president did is disgraceful, period 'Police blocked the road leading up to the WWII memorial from both directions,' wrote Curzon. 'What a nice way to spend my Sunday morning and to see how our veterans are treated at their own memorial. Last week, the Obama administration opened the mall for immigration activist protest yet blocked WWII vets in wheelchairs to see the WWII memorial. What is happening to our country?!' Later, scores of demonstrators disassembled the metal barricades around the memorial and took them to the White House nearby, where they tossed them in heaps. Regardless of your politics, it says much about the mindset of a president who would seek to punish veterans of the greatest war of the Greatest Generation, over nothing more than petty party politics and ideology. That Obama never served is not the point; that he would ever seek to punish those who have is a disgrace. Sources: http://www.breitbart.com http://weaselzippers.us http://thehill.com ",2
3," Tweet (NewsTarget) The concept of universal health care that would cover every American citizen is again being proposed in the U.S. Senate, after a similar request was voted away over a decade ago. Sen. Ron Wyden, D-Ore., brought his vision for health care coverage that would leave no man, woman or child in America without health coverage, as several business and labor leaders on Wednesday hailed his proposal to provide health care coverage to all Americans through a pool of private insurance plans. Over 12 years ago, the U.S. Congress rejected a Clinton administration plan for universal health care. However, Sen. Wyden says his plan is different in that it would provide affordable, private health care coverage for all Americans -- except those covered through Medicare or the military -- using no more money that the country spends on health care today under the current system that leaves millions uninsured. Sen. Wyden said, 'Employer-based coverage is melting away like a Popsicle on the sidewalk in August,' and proposed a plan that would 'guarantee health coverage for every American that is at least as good as members of Congress receive, and can never be taken away.' Sen. Wyden's plan -- called the 'Healthy Americans Act' -- would provide universal coverage for no more money than the country spends on health insurance today, according to the Senator. He also drew support for his plan from groups that have frequently opposed each other -- including Andy Stern, international president of the Service Employees International Union, and Safeway Inc. CEO, Steve Burd. Mr. Stern called employer-based health coverage a relic of an industrial economy that is long gone. He added that U.S. companies 'cannot compete in a global economy when we put the price of health care on the cost of our products, and our competitor nations do not.' In addition, Sen. Wyden said his new plan would give American workers the ability to carry their health insurance from job to job without penalty. He added that more efficient administration and more promotion of competition for health care plans would allow greater coverage while costing no more than the government is paying today for health insurance coverage. Sen. Wyden's universal health care plan would also require that employers 'cash out' their existing health plans by terminating coverage and paying the amount saved directly to workers as increased wages, and then workers then could buy health insurance from a large pool of private plans with that same money. ### ",4
3," I've got something in common with Donald Trump. As the editor of selfnews, people tell me all the time, 'Why don't you do a story about (fill in the blank) and expose it?' My answer is usually, 'Why don't you start your own website and write about it yourself, and we'll publicize your story?' The answer is almost always the same. 'Oh, I couldn't do that, I'd get fired from my job' (or audited by the IRS, or shut down by the FDA, etc). They always have a reason why they can't say the things they really believe... while simultaneously wanting me to say those things for them. Americans right now see Donald Trump in exactly the same way. He's the village hero they're arming with a sword while shoving him forward to face the oncoming dragon. Trump, you see, has guts. He's a warrior. He's willing to march into all the battles that everyone else desperately wants to avoid. Most people, you see, live with an astonishing lack of personal fortitude . They're easily intimidated and often find it easier to go along and get along rather than rock the boat by challenging the status quo. They're afraid to go against the grain, speak the truth in a crowded room or express an obvious fact that isn't politically correct. (Like the simple fact that vaccines damage children or that chemotherapy kills cancer patients.) But individuals like Donald Trump and the Health Ranger (that's me) have a reputation for kicking ass, speaking out and fighting for truth, even in the face of organized, systemic suppression of that truth. Because of that, people often call on us to speak up for them and say the things they are too afraid to say themselves . That's why I deeply understand why Donald Trump is so popular: He's the warrior who's willing to take on the establishment that everybody knows is crooked and corrupt . Trump is willing to say the words of truth that everybody else already believes but is too afraid to utter. 'Build a wall! Kick out the illegals!' Everybody's thinking it -- especially African-Americans who are losing their jobs due to illegals -- but few are willing to say it for fear of being publicly condemned. Donald Trump is America's surrogate mouthpiece When Donald Trump announces that politicians are stupid, the media is lying and the government is incompetent, he's speaking for all Americans who have noticed precisely the same thing. Secretly, the American people know Trump is telling the truth , even if they wouldn't dare acknowledge that in their social group or in a media interview. To maintain social conformity, people have to publicly say ridiculous things like, 'The government cares about people.' But privately, they know that's complete nonsense. And here's why this matters: Voting is anonymous. It's private. Nobody knows how you voted in an election unless you tell them . This means people can say one thing publicly while voting in precisely the opposite way at the voting booths. That's why I predict that if the 2016 election comes down to Clinton vs. Trump, Donald Trump will win in a landslide . It may never come to that, of course. I'm not sure Hillary Clinton can survive her runaway criminality and the fact that nearly all informed Americans simply don't trust her. I'm also not entirely sure that Donald Trump will become the Republican nominee, either. The idiotic GOP establishment, predictably, is trying to destroy Trump to make sure their own favorite nominee -- Jeb Bush -- gets crowned King. But if it come down to Clinton vs. Trump, I have no doubt Trump would win in a landslide for the simple reason that most people privately agree with him .

3," While there has been a lot of research both in favor and against one of America's favorite drinks, this latest bit of research leaves you feeling a little less guilty after having that second, or third, or even fourth cup of coffee. The results of a new study suggest that drinking up to four cups of coffee a day may reduce your risk of developing cancer of the endometrium, or the lining of the uterus, according to researchers. Published in the February issue of Cancer Epidemiology, Biomarkers & Prevention , scientists found that drinking roughly 26 to 37 ounces of coffee per day reduced endometrial cancer by up to 18 percent. 'We were not surprised by the results that a high versus low intake of coffee was associated with a reduced risk for endometrial cancer, because they were consistent with what has been observed in previous studies,' said study author Melissa Merritt, who is also a research fellow in cancer epidemiology at Imperial College London in England. Study: Women who drank about four cups of coffee per day were less likely to develop cancer of the endometrium, compared with those who consumed less than one cup a day Researchers reached their results using data on nearly half a million women from two large ongoing studies and studying the dietary habits of more than 2,800 women with cancer of the endometrium. 'We used similar methods to investigate the association between coffee intake and endometrial cancer as previous studies,' said Merritt. 'This is important so we can compare results across different studies.' During the study, researches found that one trial, which included drinking 37 ounces of coffee a day, reduced endometrial cancer risk by 18 percent. Another trial involving consumption of 26 ounces per day identified a similar reduction, reports CBS News . After evaluating 84 foods and nutrients, Merritt's team found that, 'For most other dietary factors, there was no consistent association with endometrial cancer risk.' It's important to note that, while researchers did identify a link, they did not find a cause-and-effect relationship between coffee drinking and lower risk of endometrial cancer. Scientists also did not differentiate between drinking decaf or regular coffee; therefore, Merritt said she couldn't comment on which one is better. Dr. Robert Morgan, a professor of medical oncology at the City of Hope Comprehensive Cancer Center in Duarte, Calif., said the new study is 'validating other studies showing coffee has a beneficial effect in decreasing endometrial cancer .' Antioxidants found in coffee may prevent or slow cell damage While researchers aren't entirely sure why coffee may help lower the risk of endometrial cancer, Merritt suggests that one reason might be because coffee reduces estrogen levels in the body, changing the balance of hormones. The risk of endometrial cancer increases when the balance between estrogen and progesterone shifts and leans more towards estrogen, according to the American Cancer Society. Being overweight, beginning menstruation earlier than normal and late menopause may increase the risk of endometrial cancer. Other risk factors include having an inherited form of colorectal cancer, never being pregnant or being infertile, and using tamoxifen to prevent or treat breast cancer. Tamoxifen is a hormone therapy drug that blocks the actions of estrogen. Endometrial cancer claims more than 10,000 lives each year in the United States In the U.S., cancer of the endometrium is the most common cancer of the female reproductive organs, according to Cancer.org . Roughly 54,000 cases are expected to be diagnosed this year, with more than 10,000 of them likely to be fatal. This type of cancer is more common among women over 45 years old, with about three out of four cases being diagnosed in women ages 55 and older.

3," Tweet Continuing with the investigative report on hoodia gordonii, a natural appetite suppressant, let's now explore the issue of how appetite control impacts weight loss. (If you missed it, click here to view part 1 .) For most people, the real weight loss challenge has relatively to do with dieting, exercise, supplements, or how many calories you burn in the gym. The real challenge is controlling their hunger drive. People who are trying to lose weight seem to share the exact same problem. It's not that they're lazy, or that they're slobs, or that they eat junk food all day, it's that they have trouble getting their appetite under control. Hoodia gordonii, it seems, could make that much easier. Because overcoming your own hunger drive seems almost impossible unless you get some help. Think about it: the last time you tried to lose weight, what was it that finally caused you to cave in? I bet it was hunger. At some point, the hunger just took over, and you found yourself eating again. So let me share a secret with you: you can't fight mother nature. Your body was designed to survive. And to survive, your body needs to find and consume large quantities of calories. The more, the better. Remember: your body was designed for an age in which calories were hard to come by. Your body was self-motivated to go find some food. In a time when food was scarce, people who found and ate more calories survived better than those who didn't, and therefore passed on their genes to their offspring. That lineage, after hundreds of thousands of years of scarcity, leads directly to you and me. We live in bodies that were designed and built to scrounge for scarce calories in the natural environment. And the method for that motivation was simple: hunger. Your body uses hunger to whip you into action. 'Go find me some berries!' it screams. 'Get me some animal fat!' It's no coincidence that animal fat and sugar are the most sought-after comfort foods: they're rich in calories, and they convince your body that you have enough food. No wonder, then, that ice cream is the opiate of the hungry: it's made primarily of milk fat and sugar -- precisely the chemicals that stimulate a feeling of comfort. But today, we live in a society where an overabundance of food surrounds us. We have the all-you-can-eat buffet, the Costco-sized food paks, the supersized fast foods. We have restaurants that serve one person what an entire family might have eaten just two generations ago, and at every social event, there's even more food beckoning: weddings, parties, holidays, movies... you name it, there's food. And so spurred on by our innate hunger motivation, and surrounded by the modern environment of unhealthy food in mass quantities, we all eat. And eat. And we put on the pounds, just like I did, just like you did. It's only human. But what if you could turn off your hunger like a switch? When you eat hoodia, the saying goes, your hunger will simply be gone -- gone -- for around six hours. During those six hours, you won't crave anything. You really won't want to eat at all. The food still smells good, as usual, and they taste the same if you eat them, but you don't want to eat them! At least that's what the hoodia advocates claim will happen. To understand how all this works, you have to understand what 'hunger' really is in the first place. Hunger is just an illusion. It's a signal in your brain, a chemical message that causes you to feel certain feelings and, ultimately, act on them. Your body creates the illusion of hunger even when you're not really needing calories. And your body, like mine, doesn't know when to turn it off. I am your hungry hypothalamus The hunger signal is only turned off when your hypothalamus thinks you've eaten enough food. Your hypothalamus -- part of your body's endocrine system -- decides this by sensing the rise of sugar (glucose) in your blood. Eat enough carbohydrates, and your blood sugar rises, which convinces your hypothalamus to tell your brain that you're no longer hungry. This is why eating an apple is such an effective appetite suppressant. Normally, to get your hypothalamus to turn off the hunger switch, you'd have to eat a moderate amount of food. And your hypothalamus isn't very quick on the draw either: it takes around 20 minutes to figure out what you've eaten, and by that time, you've probably eaten another 800 calories. So by the time your hunger signal gets turned off, you've already overeaten yet again. This chemical fools your hypothalamus Hoodia, however, contains a chemical that gets picked up by your hypothalamus which thinks it's glucose. And as it turns out, this chemical is reportedly 10,000 times more potent than glucose in triggering the chemical receptors in your hypothalamus, and so it only takes a tiny bit of this chemical to trigger the cancellation of your hunger signals. Let me say this another way: eat this chemical, and your hypothalamus thinks you've just wolfed down three plates of food at the local buffet. Your hunger is abruptly cancelled. You just don't feel hungry anymore. Everything else is fine: there are no known side effects. But you simply don't feel like eating. At least that's what the hoodia companies explain you should experience. Consuming hoodia is surprisingly simple: slice off a piece of the succulent, peel off the thorns, and just start chewing on it. You don't even need to swallow it. The taste is rather bitter by most Americans' palettes, but after several minutes of chewing, you've already started absorbing the chemical. Guess what? Your hunger is vanishing with each passing moment. The San Tribesmen, the original discovers of the plant, also say it makes you feel stronger, more energetic, and more focused. Nobody complains of any side effects whatsoever, and the plant has been chewed for literally thousand of years by various generations of the San, with no ill effects known whatsoever. Now imagine what you could achieve in terms of weight loss by taking advantage of this natural appetite suppressant. That's exactly what we'll discuss in the next installment of this investigative report series on Hoodia Gordonii. Continue with part 3. ",1
3," It's one of the few victories for the people against an out-of-control federal agency that is growing more lawless and arrogant by the year. As reported by Indian Country Today , the Bureau of Land Management, which falls under the Department of the Interior (as does the Bureau of Indian Affairs), was forced to cancel an oil and gas lease in the Badger-Two Medicine region in northwestern Montana earlier this month, thereby keeping land that is culturally and traditionally sacred to members of the Blackfoot Nation pristine. 'It's a very historic day for the Blackfeet,' said John Murray, the Blackfeet Nation's Historic Preservation Officer, Indian Country Today reported. Interior Secretary Sally Jewell, in a statement announcing the decision, said that it was the correct action to take on behalf of the tribe and its future members. 'Today's action honors Badger-Two Medicine's rich cultural and natural resources and recognizes the irreparable impacts that oil and gas development would have on them,' Jewell said. Decision ends all legal wrangling Indian Country Today reported further: The 130,000-acre Badger-Two Medicine region, part of the Lewis and Clark National Forest, is wedged between Glacier National Park, the Bob Marshall Wilderness and the Blackfeet Indian Reservation. The area is historically, culturally and spiritually significant to the Blackfeet Tribe and is part of a recognized Traditional Cultural District, characteristics that caused Congress to legislatively withdraw the area from mineral development in 2006. 'It's not a wilderness,' said Murray. 'It is a living Blackfeet landscape.' The BLM had issued a 6,200-acre oil and gas lease to Solenex, of Louisiana, under then-Interior Secretary James Watt in 1982, but operations have been in limbo since 1985. BLM since determined that the lease was not properly issued because it violated the National Environmental Policy Act and the National Historical Preservation Act, the department said. Jewell's decision came after carefully examining the record and following consultations with the U.S. Forest Service, the Advisory Council on Historic Preservation, the Blackfeet tribe, the lease-holding company and other concerned parties. A number of ethnographic studies and one archeological study have been done on the tract of land . The BLM decision ends legal attempts by the Mountain States Legal Foundation, which was litigating on behalf of Solenex in challenging the Interior Department's Nov. 23 decision to cancel the lease. Every single one of the originally issued leases to the region have undergone a plethora of administrative, legal and legislative actions since they were handed down more than three decades ago due to the significance of the Badger-Two Medicine region and over concerns about circumstances that led to the lease issuance. Refreshing change Indian Country reported that some two-thirds of original leaseholders took advantage of tax incentives that Congress established in exchange for voluntarily relinquishing leases to the region. 'There was only one lease that was subject to the court, but overall there are 18 leases,' Murray said. 'We are hopeful that the rest of them are going to be canceled also.' The BLM has been at the center of various controversies in recent years, more so than in the past. As NewsTarget.com reported earlier this month, the agency that most Americans never heard of made the news when about 200 armed agents in SWAT gear surrounded a Nevada rancher named Cliven Bundy in April 2014 with automatic weapons, helicopters and government snipers. Then in January, a group of armed men led by Ammon Bundy, Cliven Bundy's son, took over a small building on the Malheur National Wildlife Refuge to protest terroristic actions taken by the BLM against Western ranchers. As further reported by The Daily Sheeple , BLM agents were caught on video setting fires that became uncontrolled and were left to burn unmonitored around Prince Glenn, Oregon, (not very different from what another ranch family, the Hammonds, were jailed for burning government land). So, to see people actually win a legal battle against BLM and the Interior Department is a refreshing change. Sources: IndianCountryTodayMediaNetwork.com DOJ.gov NewsTarget.com ",4
3," Residents of Clearfield County, Pennsylvania, have complained about a state program to spread sewage sludge on public lands near their homes, citing health concerns. The treated sewage sludge, formally known as 'biosolids,' is intended to enrich the soil and help vegetation regrow on the site of a former strip mine that has been turned into a state game reserve. A New York waste management company has received a permit to dispose of biosolids on 50 acres of Pennsylvania state land without paying any disposal fee. Local residents such as Brian Gould, 30, who recently built a house on property abutting the game lands, have expressed concerns about the health effects of spreading treated sewage next to their homes. 'Whenever they spread it, the valley fills in with a fog,' Gould said. 'We're at the highest point around. The wind is always blowing. Whatever they spread up here is going to be carried all around.' 'It smells like if you took 40 Porta-Johns and kicked them over in July,' he said. 'And that's being nice.' Gould's wife, Allison, recently told game officials that, when the spreading began, she was hospitalized with bronchial spasms, which feel like a heart attack. The doctor told her that such spasms can be triggered by airborne pollutants. 'I'm 27. I've never had asthma or any respiratory problems,' she said. 'But that night, I had an elephant sitting on my chest. ... What is this stuff going to do to our families, to our kids?' Residents confront game officials At a recent town meeting, roughly 100 residents confronted officials of the Pennsylvania Game Commission, which is responsible for the program. 'The people here pay your wages, and we don't want it,' shouted Bell Township Supervisor Dave Kauffman. 'Pull the permits!' Although state Department of Environmental Protection spokesperson Daniel Spadoni assured residents that the biosolids site has been inspected five times with no violations found, residents said that they have been suffering from chronic headaches and nausea. 'It can't be good for you,' said Ryan Smith, 32. 'I mean, it smells like dead animals. You can sit in our living room and feel like you're eating it.' Many residents , including the Goulds, are testing their water to establish a baseline against future contamination, and Mahaffey Fire Chief Dan Wright announced at the meeting that he will refuse to dispatch firefighters to any fires that break out too close to the sludge. 'You can't guarantee it's safe, so I won't send them in,' he said, standing and jabbing his finger at the game officials. Although the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) allows for the application of treated sewage sludge as fertilizer, environmental groups such as the Sierra Club warn that biosolids may contain pollutants and disease-causing contaminants that can cause both short- and long-term harm to humans, animals and the environment. For example, contaminants could leach into nearby wells and groundwater. 'Biosolids is a euphemism for sewage sludge,' said Tom Richard, director of Penn State Institutes for Energy and the Environment. 'Before we started spreading them on our land, we used to put them in landfills and dump them in the ocean. That didn't work out so well, because some of it would wash up on the shores of New Jersey, and people didn't like that.' Richard noted that, while EPA tests have indicated that the health risks from biosolids are 'low,' it would be deceptive to claim that biosolids are completely safe. 'Unfortunately low is not zero,' he said. 'It's not zero risk for all the things they've tested, for heavy metals, pathogens, etc. Anyone who tells you it's zero risk doesn't understand the way the risk analysis was conducted.' ",4
3," On January 17, 1995, an article written by Beatrice Dexter about the benefits of honey and cinnamon powder, appeared in The Weekly World News. Please allow me to preface this article with a bit of information unbeknown to the writer and virtually everyone else: cinnamon is 26 percent sulfur based and honey is 33 percent sulfur based, making their combination 59 percent sulfur based and the reason why their combination is so effective. Honey is the only food on the planet that will not spoil or rot. Honey will crystallize if it is left in a cool dark place for the long time, but do not mistake this crystallization for it turning into sugar. Honey never will become sugar. If it does crystallize, simply loosen the lid and let the honey jar sit in boiled water, as this will allow the honey to re-liquefy naturally. It is important to note that you do not put a honey jar in boiling water while still be heated or in a microwave as these will kill the enzymes in the honey. Obviously, you will never read about this in the mainstream media because they are hookers for BigPharma and could interfere with their drug pushing profits if too many people learned about the effectiveness of sulfur-based remedies. Today's science says that even though honey is sweet and when taken in the right dosage as a 'medicine', it will not and does not harm even diabetics. Ok, all that being said, let's get to healing qualities of the sulfur-based cinnamon/honey combination as researched by Western scientists, who by the way, are clueless about the sulfur effectiveness or the fact that cinnamon and honey are sulfur based: HEART DISEASE Make a paste of honey and cinnamon powder and apply it on bread instead of jelly and jam and eat it regularly for breakfast. It reduces the cholesterol in the arteries and could prevent a heart attack. If someone already had a heart attack and you take this combination, your next heart attack may never happen. The regular use of this combination relieves loss of breath and strengthens the heartbeat. In America and Canada, various nursing homes have treated patients successfully and have found that as one ages, the arteries and veins lose their flexibility and get clogged; the cinnamon and honey combination revitalizes the arteries and veins. ARTHRITIS Arthritis patients should take, twice a day (morning and night), a cup of hot water with two tablespoons of honey and one teaspoon of cinnamon powder. When taken regularly, even chronic arthritis can be cured. In a research project conducted at Copenhagen University, it was found that when doctors treated their patients with a mixture of one tablespoon of honey and a half-teaspoon of cinnamon powder before breakfast, they found that within a week 73 out of the 200 tested were totally relieved of pain. Within a month, most all of the people who had trouble walking or moving around because of their arthritis could walk without pain. BLADDER INFECTIONS Take two tablespoons of cinnamon powder and one teaspoon of honey in a glass of lukewarm water and drink it. It will destroy the germs in the bladder. CHOLESTEROL Two tablespoons of honey and three teaspoons of cinnamon powder mixed in 16 ounces of water were found to reduce the level of cholesterol in the blood by 10 percent within two hours. As mentioned for arthritic patients, when taken three times a day, chronic cholesterol is cured. The scientists also found that pure honey taken with food on a daily basis relieves complaints of cholesterol. COLDS Those suffering from common or severe colds should take one tablespoon of lukewarm honey with one quarter of a spoonful for cinnamon powder daily for three days as this procedure will cure most chronic coughs, colds, and will clear the sinuses. UPSET STOMACH Honey taken with cinnamon powder cures stomach ache and also clears stomach ulcers for its roots. GAS According to the studies done in India and Japan, it is revealed that when honey is taken with cinnamon powder the stomach is relieved of gas. IMMUNE SYSTEM Daily use of honey and cinnamon powder strengthens the immune system and protects the body from bacterial and viral attacks. The scientists have found that honey has various vitamins and iron in larger amounts. Constant use of honey strengthens the white blood corpuscles, where the DNA is contained, to fight bacterial and viral diseases. INDIGESTION Cinnamon powder sprinkled on two tablespoons of honey taken before food is eaten relieves acidity and aids in the digestion of the heaviest of meals. INFLUENZA A scientist in Spain has proved that honey contains a natural 'ingredient', which kills the flu germs and will prevent the person from getting the flu. (I ain't no learned scientist but I do know that the natural 'ingredient' is sulfur and that those that take the organic sulfur crystals never get the flu). LONGEVITY Tea made with honey and cinnamon powder, when taken regularly, arrests the ravages of old age. Use four teaspoons of honey, one teaspoon of cinnamon powder, and three cups of boiling water to make the tea. Drink one quarter of a cup three to four times a day. It keeps the skin fresh and soft and delays aging. Life spans increase and even those in their 90s plus, will have the energy of someone half their age. Allow me to inject some humor here: I play in two senior softball leagues. One of the guys, who is 87 asks me if the sulfur crystals are good for erectile dysfunction. I tell him that they are but they must be taken twice a day. About two weeks later I ask him if he is taking the crystals. He says he is. I then ask him if he is taking them twice a day. He says he is taking them once a day. I reminded him that their utmost effectiveness is by taking them twice a day. He says that he knows that but his wife can't handle it when he takes them twice a day. RASPY OR SORE THROAT When the throat has a tickle or is raspy, take one tablespoon of honey and sip it until it is finished. Repeat this every three hours until the throat is without symptoms. PIMPLES Three tablespoons of honey and one teaspoon of cinnamon power paste. Apply this paste on the pimples before sleeping and wash it off the next morning with warm water. When done for two weeks, it removes pimples from the root (of course, eliminating sugar from the diet couldn't hurt). SKIN INFECTIONS Applying honey and cinnamon powder in equal parts to cure eczema, ringworm and all types of skin infections. WEIGHT LOSS In the morning and one half hour before breakfast and on an empty stomach, and at night before sleeping, drink honey and cinnamon powder boiled in one cup of water. When taken regularly, it reduces the weight of even the most obese person. Also, drinking this mixture regularly does not allow the fat to accumulate in the body even though the person may eat a high calorie diet. CANCER Recent research in Japan and Australia has revealed that advanced cancer of the stomach and bones have been cured successfully. Patients suffering from these kinds of cancer should take one tablespoon of honey with one teaspoon of cinnamon power three times a day for one month. FATIGUE Recent studies have shown that the sugar content of honey is more helpful rather than being detrimental to the strength of the body. Senior citizens who take honey and cinnamon powder in equal parts are more alert and flexible. A Dr. Milton, who apparently does not have a first name, has done research showing that a half tablespoon of honey taken in a glass of water and sprinkled with cinnamon powder, even when the vitality of the body starts to decrease, when taken daily after brushing and in the afternoon at about 3:00 P.M., the vitality of the body increases within a week. BAD BREATH Gargling with one teaspoon of honey and cinnamon powder mixed in hot water first thing in the morning will keep the breath fresh all day. HEARING LOSS Allegedly, daily morning and night honey and cinnamon powder, taken in equal parts restores hearing. TOOTHACHE Make a paste of one teaspoon of cinnamon powder and five teaspoons of honey and apply it to the aching tooth three times a day until the ache is gone. HIGH BLOOD PRESSURE High blood pressure and its accompanying symptoms of chest pain and dizziness disappeared in many patients' just weeks after an Italian researcher gave them regular doses of honey and cinnamon. Blood pressure improved and all 137 subjects felt better after a few weeks. REGARDING CINNAMON The cinnamon powder that you get in the super markets could very well be sawdust that has been colored and artificially flavored. I think it is better to get the bark and powder it yourself or but it from a reputable natural food store. Most spices are irradiated. This is supposedly done to eradicate bacteria, but spices are generally excellent bactericides so the irradiation is merely a way of destroying the precious properties of spices. Non-irradiated spices are available from most high-end health foods stores. Cinnamon can be confused for cassia and in fact many powdered forms use cassia ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cassia ). It is also known as 'bastard cinnamon'. True cinnamon is also known as 'Ceylon' cinnamon. There are other variants such as Indonesian and Vietnamese so avoid anything that is from these countries. Specifically ask for Ceylon Cinnamon. Cinnamomum zeylanicum is the botanical name for the purest and most potent form of cinnamon. Not long ago I wrote an article for selfnews on the 21 Reasons To Try Organic Sulfur Crystals. See if you notice the similarities in benefits. 1. Organic sulfur is not a drug or prescription medicine, but rather a nutrient that the body is deprived of. 2. It increases enzyme production within the glands of the body, substantially increasing resistance to illness. 3. It increases flexibility in the tissues within the body and increases blood circulation. 4. It reduces muscle and joint inflammation, promotes healing in the muscles and joints and prevents them from becoming sore. To the degree there is soreness, recovery and return to normality is quickened. Athletes, in particular, benefit from this as the intake of OS dramatically increases their recovery time. 5. It eliminates 'free radicals' in the body. Allergies to pollens ad certain foods can be eliminated or reduced by its use. 6. It promotes healthy, increased growth of hair and fingernails. 7. Because of the oxygenation of the cells and tissues that the OS facilitates, the body is kept in a constant aerobic environment making it so that cancer cells cannot survive or exist. 8. Studies have shown it can help reverse symptoms of osteoporosis, Alzheimer's disease and Parkinson's disease. 9. It aids in healthy skin production and the reduction of 'wrinkles'. It is one of the main ingredients in moisturizing creams. 10. It helps the body properly regulate insulin production. Adequate OS in the diet may reduce the amount of insulin injections. 11. It helps alleviate chronic headaches and migraines. Increased circulation in the brain cells promotes proper blood circulation within the brain. Less pressure and pain result, reducing tendencies for headaches. 12. It helps alleviate emphysema by providing the body with material to manufacture new, healthy cells on lung walls. 13. Because of the ability to make cell walls more permeable. OS causes the body to rapidly release and reduce alcohol 'hangover' toxins, removing them as waste from the body. The process quickens recovery time from a 'hangover', often as quickly as 20 minutes. 14. It helps in reducing and often eliminating diverticulitis. Parasites living in the intestines are unable to remain attached to the walls due to the slippery coating that the OS produces. Because of this, hatching parasitic worms are flushed out as well because they cannot attach to the walls. 15. It reduces hypoglycemia in the body because it has made it easier for the body to introduce blood sugar through more permeable cell walls. Less insulin is demanded for the process, resulting in less overuse of the pancreas. Within several months of constant usage, OS can reduce or eliminate hypoglycemia entirely. 16. It helps alleviate PMS. Glandular production is enhanced by OS to have more 'normal' levels of production. Acid, enzyme, and hormonal levels are more evenly balanced facilitating reduction of cramps, headaches, and nausea associated with the monthly cycle. 17. It helps promote better kidney function more efficiently. Water retention problems associated with poor kidney function can be alleviated. 18. It can help alleviate eye problems. Dissolve 1 teaspoon of the sulfur crystals in 4 ounces of water and use as eye drops as frequently as you like. 19. OS delivers the essential omega-3 throughout the body and also allows the body to produce vitamin B-12. 20. It has amazingly reversed countless cases of asthma and 18 cases of autism that we know about so far. 21. Last and certainly not least, it eliminates the continued need for Viagra or Cialis by reversing erectile dysfunction. This is by far the ONLY substance that can remove the poisons from pesticides, heavy metals, radiation, and other toxins.

About the author: I have been doing a weekly radio show in Honolulu since 1981 called 'Health Talk'. In 2007 I was 'forced' to get a Masters degree in Nutrition because of all the doctors that would call in asking for my credentials. They do not call in anymore. Going to www.healthtalkhawaii.com enables you, among other things, to listen to the shows. I am an activist. In addition to espousing an organic vegan diet for optimum health, I am strongly opposed to GMOs, vaccines, processed foods, MSG, aspartame, fluoridation and everything else that the pimps (Big Pharma, Monsanto and the large food companies) and the hookers (the doctors, the government agencies, the public health officials, and the mainstream media) thrust upon us, the tricks. After being vaccinated with the DTP vaccine as a child I developed asthma. After taking the organic sulfur crystals (they are harvested from the pine trees in Louisiana) in November of 2008 for 10 days my asthma reversed and has not come back over 4 years later, 18 cases, so far, of autism have been reversed, as has cancer, Alzheimer's and Parkinson's disease, osteoarthritis, joint pain, astigmatism, gum disease, increased sexual activity, heavy metal and radiation elimination, parasite elimination, free radicals elimination, faster athletic recovery time, increased blood circulation, reduced inflammation, resistance to getting the flu, reduction of wrinkles, allergy reduction, reduced PMS and monthly period pain, nausea, migraines and so much more. And it's only possible because of the oxygen it releases that floods the cells of the body. The sulfur, as proven by the University of Southampton in England, enables the body to produce vitamin B12 and the essential amino acids.

3," Tweet (NewsTarget) Since the 2003 H5N1 outbreaks, experts have been saying that if the disease becomes easily transmitted between humans, a devastating pandemic will kill millions, but Michael Osterholm, director of the Center for Infectious Disease Research and Policy at the University of Minnesota, said it is not a matter of if a flu pandemic is coming, but when. 'The worst thing we can do is not prepare and think it will not happen,' Osterholm said, but added, 'The truth of the matter is, there's a lot we can do about it.' Osterholm -- who is a consultant for the U.S. departments of Homeland Security and Human Services and has been on 'The Oprah Winfrey Show' and CNN's 'Nightline' to talk about flu pandemics -- addressed an audience at a town hall meeting in Illinois and said that history shows that a new pandemic strikes the world at least every 50 years. The last such pandemic was the Hong Kong flu -- H3N2 -- which took approximately 700,000 lives worldwide, about 40,000 of which were in the United States alone. The H5N1 strain of bird flu, which has already killed 141 people worldwide without mutating to a human-to-human strain, is likely to be the next devastating pandemic to sweep the globe, experts say. When it does, Osterholm said it is likely to kill at least 2.7 million people -- maybe as many as 360 million -- and people will probably have to take care of themselves as the devastation completely overpowers state and federal emergency management plans. 'Nobody in Washington or even Springfield is going to be here to help you, so you need to start thinking about this now,' Osterholm said to the audience, adding that communities should preempt the problem by starting their own leadership networks and planning for relief efforts and health care. 'No investment you ever make in this is going to be wasted,' he said. Osterholm said that next to a lack of preparation and assuming the pandemic will never come, the worst thing people can do is give up hope. 'Every population that endured one of these has survived it,' he said. 'We just have to keep telling ourselves that.' ### ",4
3," Prior to the current budgetary sequestration, President Barack Obama went on the record publicly warning Americans of dire consequences should the planned cuts that he himself helped devise - and eventually signed into law - be allowed to go into effect. 'This work, along with hundreds of thousands of jobs, are currently in jeopardy because of politics in Washington. In a few days, Congress might allow a series of immediate, painful, arbitrary budget cuts to take place, known in Washington as the sequester,' he said Feb. 19 at a shipyard in Newport News, Va. 'These cuts are wrong. They're not smart, they're not fair.' Continuing, Obama predicted more dire consequences: If the sequester goes into effect, more than 2,000 college students would lose their financial aid. Across the country these cuts will force federal prosecutors to close cases and potentially let criminals go. Air traffic controllers and airport security will see cutbacks and that could cause delays at airports across the country. The president also warned that the cuts would lead to furloughs of 800,000 federal defense workers , as well as layoffs of local first responders, police and firefighters (all of whom, by the way, are paid with local funds , but I digress). Self-fulfilling prophecy? After the March 1 deadline passed and the sequestered cuts became mandatory, Obama eased off his dire warnings, though with far less fanfare, admitting that the cuts would not be as devastating as he claimed they would be. 'We will get through this. This is not going to be an apocalypse, I think as some people have said,' he said, following a nearly hour-long meeting with lawmakers March 1. As you have read, 'some people' who have said the sequester was going to be apocalyptic includes, of course, the president . Apparently, however, Obama is set to make his initial claims that the sequester would be painful on Americans a self-fulfilling prophesy, according to government emails that have been publicized by the Washington Times : The Obama administration denied an appeal for flexibility in lessening the sequester's effects, with an email this week appearing to show officials in Washington that because they already had promised the cuts would be devastating, they now have to follow through on that. In the email sent Monday by Charles Brown, an official with the Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service office in Raleigh, N.C., Mr. Brown asked 'if there was any latitude' in how to spread the sequester cuts across the region to lessen the impacts on fish inspections. The answer from the White House, quite simply, was... no . 'The Obama administration is doing everything it can...' 'We have gone on record with a notification to Congress and whoever else that 'APHIS would eliminate assistance to producers in 24 states in managing wildlife damage to the aquaculture industry, unless they provide funding to cover the costs.' So it is our opinion that however you manage that reduction, you need to make sure you are not contradicting what we said the impact would be.' In other words, agency officials are being told by the president - who is head of the Executive Branch and directly oversees the vast array of government agencies - to make pain so he can blame it on the sequester and, by default, the opposition party. 'This email confirms what many Americans have suspected: The Obama administration is doing everything they can to make sure their worst predictions come true and to maximize the pain of the Sequester cuts for political gain,' said Rep. Tim Griffin, a Republican lawmaker from Arkansas. APHIS is an agency within the U.S. Department of Agriculture, and on March 5, during a congressional hearing, agency head Tom Vilsack said he hadn't seen the email Brown referenced. 'If we have flexibility, we're going to try to use it to make sure we use sequester in the most equitable and least disruptive way,' Vilsack said in response to a question from Rep. Kristi Noem, R-S.D. 'There are some circumstances, and we've talked a lot about the meat inspection, where we do not have that flexibility because there are so few accounts.' Noem said the email made it sound as if the administration was attempting to use the sequester for political gain. 'I'm hopeful that isn't an agenda that's been put forward,' she said.

3," A quarter of British young adults walk 'only when necessary,' resulting in less than 5 minutes of activity per day, according to a new study by health insurance company Bupa. The survey, conducted on 2,000 British adults, focused on young adults between the ages of 18 and 24. The researchers found that, although the British Heart Foundation recommends a minimum of 30 minutes per day spent walking, the average woman walked only 12 minutes per day, and the average man walked only 8 minutes. 15 percent of adults decided to walk somewhere but gave up partway through (switching to public transportation) at least once a week. Parents aged 42 to 54 largely attributed their children's sedentism to new technology, such as smart phones and social media, and said that they had walked more at the same age. The young adults themselves, however, had different explanations. The most common excuse given for not walking was 'I don't have anyone to walk with.' Women typically cited poor weather or fatigue, while men typically blamed lack of time or a busy schedule. Among adults in general, the most common excuses were weather (31 percent), lack of time (26 percent), lack of fitness (12 percent), not feeling safe (11 percent) and feeling too tired (11 percent). 'It's so easy to make numerous excuses but there are many health benefits to walking,' said Bupa's UK Medical Director, Paula Franklin. 'For most people it is the most accessible form of physical activity, which is also free and can be great fun. Serious health risks The findings are of particular concern given the risks of sedentism on the one hand and the fact that people are neglecting such an easy form of exercise on the other. 'Walking can usually fit easily into your daily routine and something as simple as choosing to walk even part of the way to work instead of taking the car or bus can have a huge impact on your health,' Franklin said. 'For example, adding just 20 minutes walking to your day can dramatically reduce the risk of cardiovascular disease, which includes heart disease and strokes.' In addition to obesity and heart disease, a sedentary lifestyle has been linked to an increased risk of cancer, type 2 diabetes and spinal problems. As people become less active, doctors are increasingly seeing these diseases in a younger demographic. Stating that the most common type of diabetes - type 2 diabetes - is primarily caused by obesity, he said, 'We are finding more young people aged between 25-30 years getting diabetes as compared to the earlier trend of adults aged between 45-50 developing the illness,' said physician Rejesh Naik, a member of the Indian Medical Association. Another Indian doctor, Preeti Doshi, who runs the pain clinic at Jaslok Hospital in Mumbai, also blamed sedentism for health problems striking earlier in life. 'Sedentary lifestyle , desk jobs, no exercise and poor posture attribute to spinal problem[s] which [are] affecting the age group of 35-55 the most,' he said. A childhood problem? Although the Bupa study focused on young adults, a recent study of Scottish children found that children are now becoming sedentary even as toddlers, debunking the idea that children are 'naturally' or spontaneously more active than adults. Indeed, the researchers found that the total energy expenditure, physical activity and sedentary behaviors of 78 three-year-olds were equivalent to those of sedentary or only lightly active adults. The children were still largely sedentary two years later. On average, they were expending 200 fewer calories than recommended each day, thereby starting on the path to obesity.

3," Tweet Obesity in a patient is an independent predictor of whether localized prostate cancer will progress following radiotherapy treatment, say researchers at M. D. Anderson Cancer Center. In a study reported in the Aug. 1 issue of the journal Cancer, researchers found that moderately and severely obese patients had a 99 percent greater risk of developing biochemical failure (an early marker of cancer progression) than other patients. The study also reports that obese patients had a 66 percent increased risk of having a tumor that recurs or becomes metastatic than did non-obese patients. This finding mirrors results from a parallel study by M. D. Anderson researchers, reported last year in Clinical Cancer Research, that found that a history of weight gain or obesity at the time of diagnosis also played a role in how aggressive prostate cancer may become after surgery. 'Together, these studies confirm that a man's body mass index (BMI = weight/height2) can be a significant factor in how well he fares after standard treatments for prostate cancer,' says the lead researcher of both studies, Sara Strom, Ph.D., an associate professor in the Department of Epidemiology. 'The fact that the same association was found among patients with different risk profiles, and who were treated with different therapies, would suggest that poorer outcomes in obese men are not related to differences in treatment as much as to differences in tumor behavior between obese and non-obese men,' she says. Strom adds that these findings suggest that obese prostate cancer patients should be followed more closely after treatment. 'When patients and their physicians are uncertain about the need for further therapy, our research indicates that a man's weight should be factored into that decision,' she says. According to Strom, the study is the first to examine the relationship between obesity and prostate cancer progression after primary therapy with external beam radiotherapy, a common treatment option. The researchers sought to determine whether obesity is an independent predictor of biochemical failure - a rising prostate specific antigen (PSA) level that can indicate advancing cancer - and they also wanted to know if the cancer actually progressed among those patients. To conduct the study, the scientists examined the records of 873 patients whose prostate cancer was locally confined, and who were treated with radiotherapy at M. D. Anderson between 1988 and 2001. Of these patients, 18 percent were mildly obese and 5 percent were moderately to severely obese. They found that patients who were obese tended to be diagnosed with prostate cancer at an earlier age than patients who were not obese, and also that African-American men had the highest obesity rates. After an average follow-up period of 96 months, 295 patients experienced biochemical failure, and cancer recurred in 127 of these patients. After adjusting for clinical and treatment variables among patients, the researchers found that BMI significantly predicted whether a patient would experience both rising PSA and a return of prostate cancer. For example, biochemical failure occured more quickly with increased BMI: an average of 30 months for patients with normal weight, and 26 months for patients deemed moderately to severely obese. Researchers also found that when comparing obese patients with non-obese patients, obese men had a significantly higher rate of cancer recurrence. Strom and her colleagues cannot yet say why excess BMI contributed to cancer progression, or whether losing weight after a prostate cancer diagnosis will make any difference in outcome. 'But by knowing this association, we may be able to design rational preventive strategies,' she says. ",4
3," Democratic front-runner Hillary Clinton's health was questioned after a lengthy coughing fit that abruptly interrupted her speech in Iowa recently. An audience of about 150 people had gathered at the Jewish Federation of Greater Des Moines to hear the former secretary of state's views on Israel. As she was talking about the Iran nuclear deal, the 68-year-old Clinton had to stop her speech to pop a lozenge cough drop. The Jewish Federation president David Adelman had to take over the stage while she continued to cough and reached for a glass of water to get the coughing under control and find her voice once more. In between coughs she then quickly blamed the more than a minute long coughing fit on her busy campaign schedule. 'You do talk a lot in this campaign,' Clinton then told the crowd, her voice still hoarse and raspy. This was the first of four public events in the race against Sen. Bernie Sanders to win the support of Iowa's voters. Watch the video here: It's not the first time Clinton has had one of these coughing spells. Ever since her first public coughing fit, before the House Select Committee on Benghazi on October 22, 2015, Clinton's health has been a topic of speculation. The fact that she has lozenge cough drops readily available in her pockets may be a sign that these coughing fits aren't just a one-time event. Hillary Clinton's healthcare statement In 2015, Hillary Clinton's presidential campaign released a health statement confirming hypothyroidism as well as allergies. Dr. Lisa Bardack, her physician, said she regularly takes the thyroid hormone Armour Thyroid and the anticoagulant drug Coumadin to prevent blood clots, as well as an antihistamine for seasonal pollen allergies and vitamin B12, and that she doesn't smoke and only drinks alcohol occasionally. Armor Thyroid is often given to patients with an underactive thyroid, thyroid enlargement, or to manage thyroid cancer. After taking a fall in her home in December 2012, she was given blood thinners for a blood clot in her head, and is still taking them as a precautionary measure. While her doctor says she's in excellent health and fit to serve as president, her health constantly comes under question as the coughing worsens. Woman confronts Hillary Clinton about her health During a campaign event in Burlington, Iowa, a woman asked a question regarding Clinton's health. She referred to the FOX news statement that the democratic presidential candidate 'was really not equipped to be in the White House,' because she was ill. After rolling her eyes, this is what Clinton replied: 'Oh my. Well, you know, they say nearly anything about me. I've got to tell you,' Clinton, replied with a smile, referring to FOX News. 'There are several themes they keep beating the drums on. I'll match my endurance against anybody,' she said to loud applause. 'And last spring, my doctor put out a letter and you know, said what great health.' But is she as fit as she claims, or are these coughing fits a sign of a massive hidden health problem? ",2
3," With preparations being made for the massive Jade Helm 15 military training across the American Southwest -- exercises that imagine conservative Texas and Utah as 'hostile' and more liberal states as 'permissive' -- the increasingly discredited establishment media has dishonestly seized on a handful of theories and comments to attack everyone expressing concerns about the drills. It is true that some unproven and in some cases wild claims have been made by a handful of individuals online, such as the notion that closed Walmart stores are involved in a nefarious plot with authorities to detain dissidents. However, in its deceitful efforts to demonize Americans who are suspicious of the Obama administration and the unprecedented Jade Helm 15 program, the mischaracterized 'mainstream' press has seized on those claims as if they represented the primary or even only concerns being expressed. In the process, it exposed itself as a propaganda machine. (Story by Alex Newman, republished from TheNewAmerican.com ) It is hardly a surprise that many Americans have expressed concerns about Jade Helm 15. Polls show more than two thirds of Americans believe the federal government is 'out of control' and a threat to liberty. The other third must not be paying attention. Plus, just the information that is publicly known about the military exercise is enough to raise alarm bells. Special Forces troops, for example, will be wandering through the streets of American towns with military weapons. Elite soldiers dressed in civilian clothes and driving civilian vehicles, in coordination with local law enforcement, will be seeking to 'blend in' with local communities without being detected. The fact that multiple conservative U.S. states are being identified as 'hostile,' too, is bizarre, to say the least -- especially considering the argument that the drill is to train for 'overseas' operations. All of that combined with recent developments -- numerous federal reports identifying conservatives and Christians as extremists or even potential terrorists, Obama's troubling history and background of anti-American extremism, the White House's dismal track record on honesty, and more -- have sparked legitimate concerns across America and especially Texas about Jade Helm 15. The concerns expressed by outraged citizens in town hall meetings and online were so serious and widespread that Republican Texas Governor Greg Abbott ordered the Texas State Guard to monitor the exercise. 'During the training operation, it is important that Texans know their safety, constitutional rights, private property rights and civil liberties will not be infringed,' Abbott wrote in the order to the Texas military commander.

3," Millions of Americans spray it on their bodies in the summertime to avoid getting mosquito bites, but the popular insect repellant chemical DEET appears to be going the way of antibiotics in losing its efficacy over time. A recent study published in the journal PLoS One reveals that mosquitoes are becoming increasingly less responsive to DEET, and are even now learning how to shut off their senses when exposed to it. For their research, Dr. James Logan and his colleagues from the London School of Hygiene & Tropical Medicine studied the effects of DEET on the Aedes aegypti mosquito type, which is known to bite during the day and transmit deadly diseases like yellow fever and dengue fever. Dr. Logan and his team exposed the mosquitoes to small amounts of DEET, and tracked their behavior throughout the course of several hours. What they observed is that, following three hours after exposure, many of the mosquitoes were no longer averse to DEET as they were during the first three hours. As it turns out, even minimal exposure to DEET resulted in the mosquitoes developing a type of immunity to the chemical, which was observed to no longer be effective beyond three hours after exposure. 'We think that the mosquitoes are habituating to the repellant, similar to a phenomenon seen with the human sense of smell also,' explains Dr. Logan about his findings. 'Our study shows that the effects of this exposure last up to three hours,' he adds, noting that mosquitoes previously exposed to DEET eventually adapt to it, and are no longer affected by it. It is believed that the sensory receptors of mosquitoes gradually shut down following exposure to DEET, which results in the creatures no longer being able to smell or sense it. As a result, these DEET-exposed mosquitoes are likely to return to human skin that has already been sprayed with DEET and try to tap it for blood, as if it had never been sprayed in the first place. The findings build upon earlier research by Dr. Logan, which hypothesized a genetic factor that resulted in some mosquitoes not responding to DEET. As reported by Nature back in 2010, some mosquito types have actually evolved to overcome the intended effects of DEET, thanks to a dominant gene that is sometimes passed down through mosquito families. 'That there might actually be a gene lurking in the background in mosquitoes that causes DEET resistance is the single most surprising result,' said Leslie Vosshall of Rockefeller University in New York City to Nature about the earlier study. 'This hasn't really been reported before.' ",1
3," Helicopter pilot Steve Irwin recently caught an amazing aerial view of what he says were tens of thousands of sharks congregating just south of Palm Beach, Florida. Though it is common for sharks to migrate from colder to warmer waters this time of year, what Irwin saw was nothing short of strange, as he said that countless sharks were circling around in waters where there were no visible bait-fish. 'It was truly an amazing sight,' Irwin told reporters at the U.K. Daily Mail . 'I've been a fisherman for 20 years and I also kayak out there and it's common to see [sharks] twist and turn and shoot through the air. They're prevalent at this time of year but what amazed me was the sheer numbers of them.' Owner and operator of Island Marine Services in Fort Pierce, Fla., Irwin estimates that an astounding 100,000 sharks were densely packed in the shallow waters about 100 yards off the coastline for at least 20 straight miles. But the circumstances of the event are confusing, explained Irwin, because there was no specific reason why the sharks decided to stop in the area for so long. 'It's common to see large predatory sharks come in and feed on schools of bait-fish,' he said. 'The odd thing was I didn't see any bait-fish at all!' This shark phenomenon could be somehow related to the many other strange events involving animals, including the unexplained fish and bird deaths that have occurred in recent months ( http://www.selfnews.com/030985_mysterious... ). However, it is difficult to say at this point whether or not there is any correlation, as the increase in shark numbers and lack of bait-fish could just be a simple coincidence.

3," The most savvy business person will tell you that they are always finding a better way to offer their product or otherwise make it more valuable, in order to increase sales and profits. But when that fails some companies, according to a recent lawsuit, resort to harder tactics - like extortion. A number of small businesses have filed suit against local business review start-up Yelp, Inc. , over allegations the latter's sales representatives offered to have negative reviews of businesses removed only if they bought advertising. According to The Wall Street Journal, the owner of Chicago's Bleeding Heart Bakery has alleged that Yelp 'offered in exchange for a paid sponsorship to push any bad reviews to the end of the bakery's listings on San Francisco-based Yelp's site.' The owner alleged further that a Yelp sales rep said they would personally remove reviews the owner thought were 'bogus,' according to the suit. 'Yelp's practices are extortionate and especially harmful to small businesses, such as our clients, who are particularly vulnerable to reviews posted on the site,' Jared H. Beck, co-managing partner of Beck & Lee, referring to the original plaintiff and nine new ones, told the paper. Not surprisingly, Yelp officials say the suit is bogus and without merit. 'The allegations stem from confusion over how our review filter works to protect consumers from fake reviews, and businesses from malicious reviews from competitors,' Vince Sollitto, Yelp's vice president of communications, told WSJ. But the complaints are not new. Last year, the East Bay Express newspaper ran a story describing similar allegations by businesses that Yelp sales reps were trying to help bad reviews in exchange for ad sales. According to that report, a Yelp rep offered to 'move' a local restaurateur's bad reviews 'for $299 a month.' Moreover, the restaurateur reported that the bad reviews of his business - which were, by far, the minority of reviews his restaurant received - even seemed seedy. 'When you do get a call from Yelp, and you go to the site, it looks like they have been moved,' the owner, John, said. 'You don't know if they happen to be at the top legitimately or if the rep moved them to the top. You don't even know if this is someone who legitimately doesn't like your restaurant. Almost all the time when they call you, the bad ones will be at the top.' In the end, it looks like the courts will decide whether or not Yelp's business model was taken from an old mafia playbook.

3," Tweet (NewsTarget) Women can reduce their risk of breast cancer by breast-feeding, even if they have their first child later in life, according to a study presented at the annual meeting of the American Association for Cancer Research in Los Angeles. Researchers analyzed data on women who had participated in the Women's Contraceptive and Reproductive Experiences (CARE) Study, the results of which were published in 2003. In the current study, researchers looked at the data for women over the age of 54, 995 of whom had breast cancer and 1,498 of whom did not. They compared the women's risk of acquiring breast cancer with their history of breastfeeding and their age at first birth. There are 200,000 new cases of breast cancer in the United States every year, and it is the third most common cause of cancer death in the country. There are two main types of breast tumors: those that contain hormone receptors, and those that do not. Researchers have previously found that having a first child after the age of 25 increases a woman's chance of acquiring hormone-receptor-positive breast cancer. Among women who have their first child before the age of 25, those who have many children have an even lower breast cancer risk. In the current study, researchers found that breastfeeding decreased a woman's risk for both receptor-positive and receptor-negative cancers, regardless of the age at which she had her first child. 'As more women may choose to delay pregnancy until after 25, it is important to note that breastfeeding provides protection against both estrogen and progesterone receptor positive and negative tumors,' said Giske Ursin, an associate professor of preventive medicine at the Keck School of Medicine of the University of Southern California.' 'Breastfeeding may have a protective effect that negates the increased risk of breast cancer associated with late pregnancies,' Ursin said. ",4
3," In a desperate bid to bring customers back through their doors, Taco Bell has mapped out a plan to start serving alcohol at new urban locations. Taco Bell plans to sell anything from beer and wine to 'mixed alcohol freezes.' The first Taco Bell bar design will be featured at a select location in Chicago this summer and will take an entirely new approach to fast food. The new restaurant design has already been launched in South Korea, Japan and the United Kingdom. The fast food chain, owned by Yum Brands Inc., is desperately trying to court millennials who have fallen out of love with the brand's cheap fast food image. Marketers believe more millennials now prefer restaurants that are more authentic and less run-of-the-mill like Taco Bell. Trying to shed their cheap, cookie cutter image, the new urban Taco Bell will feature a row of lime green stools and a bar that faces the kitchen and a brick wall where local artists can showcase their creativity. The new marketing plan will feature the work of local artists to bring back a familiar, neighborhood feel. The first Taco Bell to sell alcohol and feature local artwork will be the location in the Wicker Park neighborhood in Chicago. Corporate Taco Bell headquarters has no plans to turn their other franchises across the country into bars, but they do have plans to take out some controversial additives from their food offerings. In a rush to bring back business, Taco Bell has recently announced their plan to eliminate artificial colors and flavors from their food , including added trans fats and high fructose corn syrup. While it's a step in the right direction, Taco Bell food is far from healthy. You pretty much have to be intoxicated to eat Taco Bell food in the first place No matter how it's redesigned, Taco Bell represents the bowels of American fast food. Pig out on this food over the weekend and come Monday morning your bowels might not be working so well as you writhe in pain on the toilet. There's hardly any nutrition in these empty-calorie foodstuffs. On top of that, no one really knows if their taco meat is real at all. If it is, were the cows raised on GMO grains, antibiotics and growth-stimulant drugs? Some people might be able to stomach this kind of food once a year, but someone who eats Taco Bell once or twice a week would have to be intoxicated with some kind of substance in order to claim this food as acceptable for their stomach. What the menu has to offer is nothing close to real food, let alone authentic Mexican food. Maybe this is why Taco Bell is experimenting with selling beer. If their customers would just loosen up, then they might stay a while and consider buying a few more bean burritos. By the way, bean burritos are one of the simplest foods to make. Why did Taco Bell turn a simple bean burrito into a complicated nightmare of ingredients? Take a look at the ingredient list for a Taco Bell bean burrito... First there are the pinto beans and the seasoning blend, which should be all that's in it, but there's also soy oil which includes shortening with TBHQ and citric acid to protect the flavor. The burrito filling also includes autolyzed yeast extract, sunflower oil, maltodextrin, inactivated yeast, corn flour, sugar, 'natural flavors,' trehalose, (genetically) modified corn starch and silicone dioxide for processing. With this onerous list of ingredients in the bean burrito filling alone, it's no wonder Taco Bell is pledging to take some additives out to make customers feel better. Adding alcohol to the menu might help customers accept the food again too, as the Taco Bell brand tries to bring back that good feeling that has been lost ever since customers started figuring out that this kind of food was making them sicker and more putrid than ever before.

3," Three Namibian women have filed a lawsuit against the country's government, claiming they were sterilized at state-run hospitals without their informed consent after being diagnosed with HIV. 'HIV-positive women are holding the health system accountable for the wrongs done to them,' said Veronica Kalambi of the Women's Health Network. The plaintiffs are represented by the Legal Assistance Center, which says it has collected evidence of 15 such forced sterilizations since 2008. The three women are seeking one million Namibian dollars (U.S. $130,000) in damages. 'We want a health system based on human rights which promotes equality for all,' said Amon Ngavetene of the Legal Assistance Center. According to Ngavetene, women in Namibia who are diagnosed with HIV are often urged by their doctors to undergo sterilization operations. The women are not always given a clear explanation of the risks and consequences of the procedure, nor of the alternatives available (such as drugs) to prevent mother-to-child transmission of the virus. In addition, doctors do not always take into account pre-existing conditions that might make the sterilization more dangerous. All these problems are exacerbated by communication barriers in a country with 11 indigenous languages. Hundreds of people marched in support of the women in the Namibian capital of Windhoek, as well as in South Africa, Zambia, the United Kingdom and the United States. Supporters also held sit-ins at two of the hospitals accused of performing the procedures. According to protest organizer Vicky Noa, women deserve 'peace of mind that if you have HIV you can still go to the hospital and be treated with dignity and equality.' 'If we were scared that we might be sterilized, we will not use the hospital services as much,' she said. 'We do not want to be denied the right to motherhood.' According to the Joint United Nations Program on HIV and AIDS, one in five Namibians, or 200,000 people, have been diagnosed as HIV positive.

3," Great white sharks, formerly thought to have a maximum lifespan of about 20 years, can actually live as long as human beings, according to a new study that may have serious implications for ocean conservation. The study was led by the Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution and published in the journal PLOS ONE . 'White sharks in the northwest Atlantic are considerably older than previous age estimates,' researcher Li Ling Hamady said. Great white sharks are among the ocean's top predators. Although they are most common in temperate and subtropical waters, they migrate over vast distances and can be found in almost any part of the ocean. Nuclear tests provide key The most common method for estimating age in fish involves counting layers of mineralized tissue in certain body parts that grow consistently throughout the animal's life. Much like tree rings, the number of bands present can indicate an animal's age. Previous studies, assuming that shark growth bands are deposited annually, have pegged the oldest great white sharks at 22 and 23 years of age, identified in the southwestern Pacific and western Indian oceans, respectively. But the assumption that growth bands are deposited annually - or even that their rate of deposition is consistent throughout life - has remained untested. In addition, the banding patterns in great white sharks tend to be narrower and less distinct than in other species, making them more difficult to count. 'Traditionally, ageing sharks has relied on the assumption that band pairs are annual. In many cases this has been proven correct for part or all of a species life, however in more and more cases this is being disproven,' said researcher Lisa Natanson of the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration's Northeast Fisheries Science Center lab in Narragansett, R.I. For the new study , researchers took advantage of the fact that nuclear testing during the 1950s and 1960s flooded the oceans with radioactive carbon, or carbon-14. Because carbon-14 degenerates into non-radioactive carbon at a consistent rate, the researchers were able to use carbon-14 concentrations to date the different tissue layers in the vertebrae of four male and four female great white sharks caught in the northwestern Atlantic Ocean between 1967 and 2010. The study showed that the oldest of the four females was 40 years old, while the oldest male was 73. If a lifespan of 70 years or more is typical, that would make great white sharks among longest lived of all cartilaginous fishes. The study also confirmed that, while growth bands are indeed laid down annually in small to medium-large great white sharks, the rate of band deposition may change later in life. In addition, many bands become so thin that they are effectively uncountable. 'This research demonstrates the power of applying cutting-edge techniques in isotope geochemistry to answer fundamental questions in ocean ecology,' researcher Simon Thorrold said. 'The radiocarbon time stamp in white shark vertebrae provides irrefutable evidence of white shark longevity that had proved to be impossible to verify using traditional age estimation methods.' Conservation implications The study also shows that great white sharks grow and mature much more slowly than had previously been thought. This implies that the species is even more vulnerable to overfishing, habitat degradation and other extinction risks than had been previously thought. 'These findings change the way we model white shark populations and must be taken into consideration when formulating future conservation strategies,' researcher Greg Skomal said. 'Understanding longevity of the species, growth rate, age at sexual maturity, and differences in growth between males and females are especially important for sustainable management and conservation efforts,' Hamady said.

3," Evidence is increasingly emerging that a Western diet may be a significant risk factor for asthma. Asthma is a growing and serious health problem worldwide. According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention , in 2003 asthma was responsible for 4,261 deaths, 484,000 hospitalizations, 1.2 million hospital outpatient visits and 1.9 million emergency room visits across the United States. One of the studies providing strong support for a link between asthma and a Western diet was published in the European Respiratory Journal in 2008. French and Mexican researchers divided 54,672 French women into three separate groups, classified by their overall dietary habits: a 'prudent' pattern, characterized by high intake of fruits and vegetables; a 'nuts and wine' pattern, characterized by those foods; and a 'Western' pattern, characterized by high intake of cured meats, pizza, desserts and salty pies. The researchers found that participants in the 'Western' group experienced significantly more asthma attacks than participants in the other groups, while participants in the 'nuts and wine' group (perhaps approximating the Mediterranean diet) experienced significantly fewer. 'Overall diet could be involved in frequent asthma exacerbations, one aspect of asthma severity,' the researchers concluded. Cut out those hamburgers This was followed by a study published in the journal Thorax in 2010, which looked at more than 50,000 children in 20 separate countries. The researchers found that among children living in wealthy countries, eating three or more hamburgers per week was associated with a significantly higher risk of developing asthma . This link was not seen in poorer countries; in all countries, however, a higher intake of fruits and vegetables was associated with a significantly lower risk of developing asthma. A 2013 study, published in the journal Allergy , found an even stronger effect, with children who ate one hamburger per week shown to be 75 percent more likely to suffer from asthma and twice as likely to suffer from wheezing as children who ate fewer hamburgers. Other fast foods were also linked to increased asthma risk. Another large study, also published in 2013, looked not just at hamburgers but at a large number of foods including meat, fish, fast food, dairy products, eggs, fruits and vegetables, potatoes and various grain products. Only fast food intake was significantly associated with increased asthma risk among both younger and older children. Only consumption of fruit three or more times a week was associated with a lower risk in both age groups. Higher fast food intake also increased the occurrence and severity of asthma symptoms in both younger and older children. 'Such consistency adds some weight to the possible causality of the relationship,' the researchers wrote. Change your diet for immediate relief According to a 2010 study conducted by researchers from the University of Newcastle , a high-fat diet like the Western diet might not just increase your risk of developing asthma, but may actually worsen the immediate effects of the disease. Researchers assigned 40 participants to eat either a high-fat meal containing 1,000 calories (52 percent from fat ) or a low-fat meal containing 200 calories (13 percent from fat). The researchers found that immediately after the high-fat meal, participants had significantly higher levels of inflammation-triggering cells called neutrophils in their sputum than participants who had eaten the low-fat meal. In addition, three to four hours after the meal, participants in the high high-fat group were less responsive to an asthma inhaler than those in the low-fat group. 'This suggests that strategies aimed at reducing dietary fat intake may be useful in managing asthma,' researcher Lisa Wood said. ",4
3," Deep down, we all have a deeply rooted desire to live a long and high quality life. Modern medicine is certainly enabling us to live longer, but often at a cost that creates a much lower quality of life. So how do we live a longer life and also enjoy the high quality that we all wish we could capture, so we can remain as youthful as possible up until our demise? These 5 tips are a great start. Improve your diet Eating a healthy diet is one of the primary components to a long and healthy life. However, due to a contaminated and nutrient deficient food supply, incorporating a healthy diet has become more difficult. Choosing a whole food diet that is as fresh, clean, and as raw as possible is a big step forward in improving your longevity and quality of life. Examples of these types of whole foods include: ",1
3," There is new concern over evidence that growth and sex hormones in beef can cause genital abnormalities in boys, and early onset of puberty in girls. British Veterinary Products Committee (VPC) member and chemical expert John Verall was appointed to the government's VPC to represent consumer interests. He recently defied a government gag order, revealing evidence from the study which showed a rise in the rates of breast and prostate cancer in the United States, where two-thirds of all cattle are pumped full of hormones. Of special concern to Verall are the hormones melegestrol acetate, progesterone, testosterone, trenbolone and zeranol. These hormones are known to disrupt the body's natural balance, causing a number of biological effects. 'There is clear evidence of the risk to human health posed by these hormones,' Verall said, citing research that showed oestradiol is considered to be a cancer risk. Studies show that 97 of every 100,000 U.S. women have breast cancer, whereas only 67 of every 100,000 European women are afflicted. Verall added that according to recent studies, children are particularly sensitive to these hormones, which can cause 'sudden growth or breast development, even at levels which are difficult to detect in the laboratory.' Currently, the European Union prohibits the use of growth or sex hormones to speed the maturity of cattle and fatten them up, but there are doubts as to whether the ban has been enforced, because there is no testing for hormone residue in beef imported to the EU. The U.S. government has attempted to have the ban lifted, a move supported by Prime Minister Tony Blair and his administration. ### ",4
3," You can eliminate bedbugs from your home without chemicals, using traps that can be built for about a dollar's worth of supplies, say scientists at the University of Florida. 'This concept of trapping works for places where people sleep and need to be protected at those locations,' entomologist Phil Koehler said. In recent years, bedbugs have become a growing problem across the United States, with the blood-sucking insects turning up in cities nationwide. According to an April 2013 survey by the National Pest Management Association, 99.6 percent of all pest management professionals in the country had encountered at least one bedbug infestation in the previous year. Forty-nine percent of those surveyed said that most infestations occurred during summer. The association said that summer might be a busy bedbug season because more people are traveling or relocating, and are either bringing bedbugs back into their homes or discovering them in their new location. Although most famous for living in mattresses and bedding, bedbugs can live in nearly any furniture. Their bites are often confused for mosquito bites or rashes, allowing them to go undetected for long periods of time. Traps are cheap, safe and effective Because bedbugs have now become resistant to most pesticides, people often turn to extreme measures to deal with them. But Koehler warns that techniques such as mothballs, bug bombs or pesticide treatment of mattresses are either ineffective or dangerous. In contrast, the traps are an easy way to both determine if your home has bedbugs , and to eliminate them if an infestation is confirmed. Koehler estimates that it would take about an afternoon to make the 50 traps needed to remove bedbugs from a three-bedroom apartment. Compared with the average $3,000 price tag for bedbug extermination in such a space however, the time investment may be well worth it. It can cost $1,200 to eliminate bedbugs even from a small apartment. The traps, made with glue, masking tape and inexpensive plastic containers, present the bedbugs with a rough surface that makes it possible for them to get in, but with a smooth surface inside that makes it impossible for them to get out. They are designed to trap the insects as they move from their daytime hiding places in search of victims to feed on. The simple nature of the traps makes them basically foolproof, Koehler said, and much safer than the alternatives. 'It's really hard to mess this up to the point that you'd hurt anything,' he said. Five easy steps You can find instructions, photos and videos of how to construct the traps on the web site of the university's Institute of Food and Agricultural Sciences. In essence, however, all that is required is: 1. Cut four pieces of rough-surfaced tape into lengths at least the height of a small plastic container. 2. Press the pieces of tape along the inside of the container, evenly spaced. 3. Wrap more tape around the outside of a larger plastic container, from its base to its upper edge. 4. Glue the smaller container inside the larger one, making sure to leave space between the walls of the containers. 5. (optional) Dust the space between the walls of the containers with baby powder. The bedbugs will be able to climb into the larger container and perhaps even into the smaller one, but will be trapped in the 'moat' between the two containers and unable to escape. The traps should be placed underneath the legs of all furniture in the home, including beds, chairs and sofas. Trapping should continue until no more bedbugs are turning up inside the traps.

3," Medicare spends more than a billion dollars every year on a variety of breast cancer screenings, especially mammography. There must be a good medical reason for these tests, right? Not according to researchers at Yale School of Medicine. In a study just published online in JAMA Internal Medicine, the scientists say there is no evidence spending this huge amount of money on breast screening benefits older women at all. The research team, headed by Cary Gross, M.D., associate professor of internal medicine at Yale School of Medicine and director of the Cancer Outcomes, Public Policy, and Effectiveness Research (COPPER) Center at Yale, assessed overall national costs, as well as variation in costs across geographic regions, of breast screenings in older women, associated work-ups and treatment of any findings. In all, the group studied over 137,000 women on Medicare who had not been diagnosed with breast cancer in prior years. The women were followed for two years so the researchers could learn how they were screened, whether they were diagnosed with breast cancer, and how much the screening and associated treatments cost. Spending more does not increase cancer detection 'Although screening costs varied more than two-fold across geographic regions, there was no evidence that higher expenditures (due to the use of newer, more expensive screening technologies) in the higher-cost areas were benefiting women living in the high-cost regions,' Gross, who is a member of Yale Cancer Center, said in a media statement. 'Specifically, there was no relation between screening expenditures and the detection of advanced cancers.' Amazingly, despite the fact guidelines from the United States Preventive Services Task Force state there's no good evidence that breast cancer screenings have any benefit for women who are age 75 and older, the new research revealed that over $400 million is being spent every year screening Medicare beneficiaries in this very age group. 'In some instances, breast cancer screening can save lives. But no woman wants to undergo testing if it is likely to cause more harm than good, and no health system -- particularly ours -- can afford to spend hundreds of millions of dollars on screening programs without evidence to support them,' Gross concluded in the media statement. As N aturalNews has previously reported, University of California at San Francisco researchers have also sounded the alarm that unneeded, expensive mammograms are being pushed on elderly women -- specifically those who are incapacitated from Alzheimer's disease or other forms of dementia and likely terminally ill, especially if the women have savings or assets of $100,000 or more. The study, which was published in the American Journal of Public Health , was based on information from Medicare claims. ",4
3," Tweet (NewsTarget) Abraham Lincoln (1809-1865) showed a special interest in and appreciation for homeopathic medicine. In 1854, before Lincoln was elected president, he was retained as a lawyer to prepare a state legislative proposal to charter a homeopathic medical college in Chicago. Because Chicago was the home of the American Medical Association, which had been founded in 1847 in part to stop the growth of homeopathy, Lincoln's job was no simple effort. However, many of Chicago's most prominent citizens and politicians participated on the board of trustees of the proposed Hahnemann Medical College, including Chicago's mayor, two congressmen, an Illinois state representative, a Chicago city councilman, the co-founder of Northwestern University, the founder of Chicago Union Railroad, and several medical doctors who were homeopaths (Spiegel and Kavaler, 2002). Despite significant opposition, Lincoln was successful in obtaining a charter for the homeopathic college. Today, the Pearson Museum at Southern Illinois University has an exhibit of a nineteenth-century doctor's office and drug store; included in this exhibit is a homeopathic medicine kit from the Diller Drug Store of Springfield, Illinois. The exhibit notes that Abraham Lincoln was a frequent customer of the drug store and a regular user of homeopathic medicines (Karst, 1988, 11). Lincoln surrounded himself with advocates for homeopathy, especially his most trusted advisor and Secretary of State, William Steward. Ultimately, the story of what happened to William Seward is a classic story in medical history that exemplifies conventional medicine's attitude toward and actions against unconventional medical treatments and the physicians who provide them. On the night Lincoln was assassinated, Seward was stabbed in the multi-person assassination plot against the Union. Thanks to the medical care provided by Joseph K. Barnes, MD, U.S. Surgeon General, Seward survived. However, because Seward's personal physician was a homeopathic doctor and because the AMA had a policy that it was an ethical violation to consult with a homeopathic doctor or even provide care for a homeopathic patient, Dr. Barnes was denounced by the vice president of the AMA for providing medical care (Haller, 2005, 192). In addition to choosing Seward to be his secretary of state, several leading advisors were homeopathic advocates. On November 1, 1861, Lincoln appointed Major General George Brinton McClellan (1826-1885) to command the Union army during the Civil War. However, in late December McClellan contracted typhoid fever, which left him unable to go to his office to conduct business (Rafuse, 1997). During the first week of McClellan's illness, two homeopathic doctors arrived from New York to care for the ill general and his father-in-law and chief of staff, Randolph B. Marcy, who was also ill. McClellan's decision to employ homeopathic doctors is particularly interesting considering the fact that the general came from a family of prominent conventional physicians. Despite this serious illness, General McClellan remained active, giving regular orders to his subordinates, arranging for troop movement and supply transport, meeting with the president on a weekly basis, issuing court martial orders, and even providing commendations to officers. By January 2, he seemed to be much better and shortly afterwards he had no noticeable physical limitations. McClellan lived another twenty-three years. Despite the success of this homeopathic treatment on the military leader of the Union army, that very month, January 1862, the Army Medical Board rejected requests by homeopathic doctors to serve in military hospitals, arguing that to grant this request would invite applications from all types of quacks and charlatans claiming medical expertise. Typhoid fever caused more deaths during the Civil War and the Spanish-American War than the deaths caused by bullets (Wershub, 1967, 175). Despite the fact that homeopathy gained widespread popularity in the United States and Europe due to its successes in treating various infectious disease epidemics of the mid- and late-1800s, including typhoid epidemics (Bradford, 1900; Coulter, 1973), the antagonism against homeopathy and homeopaths led to government regulations stipulating that graduates of homeopathic medical colleges could not receive a commission for military service. In Connecticut, several 'irregular' physicians offered their services to the governor, who accepted them, but the examining board of the Union army rejected them and instead accepted recruits from a hastily graduated class from Yale College. Although the Union army had strict restrictions against homeopathic physicians, the Confederate army did not. In fact, the physician to the wife of the Confederate army's General Robert E. Lee was a homeopathic doctor, Alfred Hughes, MD (Hughes, 1904, 39). At least in one incidence, General Lee himself was known to have taken homeopathic medicines (Mainwaring and Riley, 2005). Thankfully, the antagonism toward homeopaths was not as severe during World War I; almost 2,000 homeopathic physicians were commissioned as medical officers. Even the American Red Cross authorized a homeopathic hospital unit (Dearborn, 1923). Lincoln was also known to appoint some homeopathic physicians to political positions. For instance, in 1863 he appointed Dr. J. G. Hunt, author of a book on homeopathy and surgery (Hill and Hunt, 1855), to be consul to Nicaragua (King, 1905, I, 177). Lincoln also signed a bill into law that gave the president the authority to make appointments to the Union army's medical department, including homeopaths (Haller, 2005, 187). However, orthodox physicians strongly asserted that they would not work with homeopaths in any way, thus creating new and more difficult problems in military medicine. Although Lincoln surrounded himself with advocates for homeopathy, that didn't protect the medical science from his famous wit. He once called homeopathy 'medicine of a shadow of a pigeon's wing.' On a more serious note, it should also be mentioned that the personal physician to Mary Lincoln (1818-1882) during the later part of her life was a homeopathic physician and surgeon from Chicago, Dr. Willis Danforth. Mary Lincoln was known to have experienced serious bouts of depression after her husband was assassinated and two of her children died, one at age 11 (1862) and the other at 18 (1871). Mary Lincoln became the sole heir of the Lincoln estate and her extravagant spending and unusual behavior later in life concerned her son Robert so much that in 1874, he sought to get her declared insane and sent to a mental asylum. The testimony of her homeopath, Danforth, confirmed her insanity because he noted that Mrs. Lincoln experienced 'nervous derangement' and had delusions. She was committed to the asylum, but was free to move about the grounds, and was released three months later. Recent research has uncovered strong evidence to suggest that Mary Lincoln also suffered from syphilis, which may help explain her crazed mental state (Hayden, 2003, 120-132).

3," Sticking more closely to a Mediterranean diet may lead to a longer life, according to a new study published in the Archives of Internal Medicine . The researchers say that the study is the first to examine a connection between the diet and mortality in a U.S. population. Researchers examined data on more than 160,000 women and 200,000 men who had filled out detailed questionnaires about their eating habits, weight, age, smoking status and other factors known to affect health. The researchers then ranked participants based on how closely they held to either a traditional Mediterranean diet or an alternate Mediterranean diet. Participants scored higher for adherence to a traditional Mediterranean diet if they ate more fruits and nuts, grains, beans, fish and vegetables (excluding potatoes), and if they ate less dairy, meat or saturated fat. Those who drank a moderate amount of alcohol, defined as five to 25 grams per day for women and 10 to 50 grams per day for men, also scored higher. The alternative Mediterranean diet was scored similarly, but included only whole (not refined) grains, did not include dairy products, counted fruits and nuts separately, used the same alcohol standard for men and women, and deducted points for meat only if it was red or processed. The people who stuck most closely to either Mediterranean diet were significantly less likely to die during the first five years after the surveys were taken. Among women who followed the alternate Mediterranean diet most closely, mortality was reduced by 22 percent, with mortality form heart disease 21 percent lower and deaths from cancer lowered by 14 percent. The numbers for men were similar. The association between the Mediterranean diet and decreased mortality seemed strongest among smokers, particularly smokers who were of healthy body weight.

No better example of this exists than the recent airing of Asiana Flight 214 pilot names by a Fox News affiliate KTVU of the San Francisco Bay area. On live television, a Fox newscaster proudly announced they had discovered the names of the pilots and confirmed them with the NTSB. They pilots names were reported as: Sum Ting Wong Wi Tu Lo Ho Lee Fuk Bang Ding Ow Watch the video yourself (below) to hear a journalist mindlessly read these names without even realizing how she was being completely punked. For the record, we here at selfnews express great sorrow for the lives lost in this tragedy, and do not demean them in any way by covering this story. This is about the idiocy of the media in being so easily punked in their reporting about the crash. Mainstream media IQs plummeting faster than broken airplanes The fact that a mainstream TV journalist can be so easily punked brings up all sorts of interesting questions. For example: why are mainstream media teleprompter readers suffering from IQs that are plummeting faster than a crashing jetliner? For starters, you have to be incredibly stupid not to realize these names are a total joke as you're reading them aloud . How can you read, out loud, 'Sum Ting Wong' and not realize these are Bart Simpson-style name jokes? And then there's the deeper question of why a Bay-area journalist wouldn't also immediately recognize these names sound more like Cantonese names, not Korean. Common Korean names sound more like 'Kim Jun Woo,' not 'Ho Lee Fuk.' But alas, these TV journalists have probably never left the USA and so are utterly clueless about global culture. What did we expect? But my favorite part about all this is that this reporter just mindlessly reads anything that appears on the teleprompter. Watch the video for yourself: Hey, helmet head: Is that hair real? It's worth noting, however, that if all of Flight 214 passengers had been wearing the grand helmet of impenetrable hair that this Fox news reporter wears on the set, they would have all been well protected from head injuries. There's nothing more pukishly politically correct than a head of hair that just screams, 'I'M NOT CONTROVERSIAL!' It actually looks like the redhead equivalent of a Darth Vader helmet, minus the breathing apparatus. Eventually realizing it had been punked, channel 2 news issued a 14-second apology in which it claimed an 'NTSB official' had confirmed the names! Here's the apology video: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFDwgJa7JOI So apparently if the NTSB told this TV news crew that the airplane was also levitated by magic, and somehow 'the magic broke,' they would report that, too. This just demonstrates the mindless subservience to government that's routinely practiced in the mainstream media . It also goes to show you how loosely this term 'official' is being thrown around. It turns out this 'official' was actually an NTSB intern who was having a little too much fun with the mainstream media. We don't know the name of this intern, but we salute him and his remarkable news making genius in allowing the mainstream media to demonstrate what a bunch of buffoons they truly are. selfnews grants the coveted ' Sum Ting Wong ' award to this anonymous intern in the hopes that his leadership and innovation may inspire countless others to mess with the media and get them to read, on air, names like 'Ho Lee Fuk.' Because for just one moment, all the viewers couldn't help but see what a total farce the mainstream media has truly become. ",1
3," Tweet It's true: cocoa can prevent and reverse cancer. That's because it's loaded with powerful phytochemicals found naturally in the cacao plant -- the source of cocoa and just one of many Amazon herbs. But in the real world, people will take this information and misuse it: they'll stuff down chocolate bars loaded with refined sugars, and they'll tell themselves that it's good for them! In reality, cocoa is a powerful medicinal herb, but almost nobody in America has ever tasted cocoa by itself. In America and most western societies, cocoa is always consumed with massive quantities of sugar and other food additives. The result? It's probably worse for you than eating nothing at all. If you really want the benefits of cocoa (and, yes, the anti-cancer benefits are real), you'll have to find chocolate bars made with pure cocoa, and made without any sugars or artificial sweeteners. You can also buy nutritional supplements containing theobromine cacao (cocoa). ",1
3," At a time when the nation was involved in two wars and there was already plenty of strain on the military's budget, Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid, D-Nev., was pressuring the Defense Department to spend scarce Pentagon resources (and taxpayer dollars) to research irritable bowel syndrome. The revelation was contained in a new book, Duty , by former Defense Secretary Robert Gates, who admitted when he received the request from Reid that he didn't quite know how to react to it, especially given that with 'all the major issues we had to deal with, my personal contacts with Senate Majority Leader Reid were often in response to his calls about Air Force objections to construction of a windmill farm in Nevada because of the impact on their radars,' Gates wrote. 'He also once contacted me to urge that Defense invest in research on irritable bowel syndrome,' he said. 'With two ongoing wars and all our budget and other issues, I didn't know whether to laugh or cry.' It wasn't the only time that Reid, who has a history of outrageous behavior and silly requests, got on the bad side of Gates. 'Disgraceful' The former defense chief, who served during the Bush and Obama administrations, said that one time the Senate majority leader made the comment during the troop surge in the Iraq War that 'this war is lost' [ http://www.youtube.com ] - a statement that Gates described as 'disgraceful.' 'I think the troops knew the score,' Gates said recently during an interview on MSNBC. 'The troops believed and believe that they were being successful in their mission. So I think they were able to a certain extent to set aside the politics here at home.' 'Although,' he said emphatically, 'I make the point in the book: when you have somebody like the Senate Majority Leader come out in the middle of the surge and say 'this war is lost' - I thought that was one of the most disgraceful things I've heard a politician say. That sends a riveting message to kids who are putting their lives on the line every day, that they're doing it for nothing, and that was absolutely not the case.' In his book, Gates wrote this about the incident: 'I was furious and shared privately with some of my staff a quote from Abraham Lincoln I had written down long before. 'Congressmen who willfully take actions during wartime that damage morale and undermine the military are saboteurs and should be arrested, exiled or hanged.'' In the days since, Reid has fired back at Gates, impugning his character - which is typical for a politician to do - and questioning his motives for writing Duty . 'Just out to make a buck ' In comments last week, Reid said Gates was making certain charges about him and others in the Obama administration because he was 'out to make a buck' (though Gates' net worth is already north of $5 million - about the same as Reid's). 'He denigrates everybody, everyone, Secretary (of State Hillary Rodham) Clinton, the president, (Vice President) Joe Biden, me,' Reid told reporters. He added that he hadn't talked to Obama about the book but he has spoken to Biden about it. 'We just lamented how disappointed we were. It's obvious it's to sell a book,' he said. 'I'm surprised he would in effect denigrate everybody he came in contact with in an effort to make a buck.' Elsewhere in the book, Gates described additional interaction with Reid, saying the Nevada Democrat called him in 2008 before Obama had named a running mate, as reported by the Associated Press: 'Reid said he was thinking about me. ... He asked if I had a public position on abortion; I laughed, saying no. He asked if I was a longtime Republican; I said actually, no.' Gates wrote that Reid wanted to keep the conversation private, adding, 'I couldn't figure out if he was serious, if it was just idle flattery, or if he was delusional.'

3," Tweet (NewsTarget) A diet rich in fiber can halve the risk of breast cancer among young women, according to a new study by Leeds University. Cereal fiber, such as that found in whole bread and cereals, was found to be particularly effective. '[This] study further highlights the importance of eating a healthy diet for reducing the risk of cancer,' said Ed Yong, information officer for Cancer Research UK. Researchers found no significant effect, however, on the breast cancer risk of post-menopausal women. Janet Cade, who headed the study, says that this is why no one has noticed the effects of fiber on breast cancer before. 'Previous research hasn't shown a convincing link between increased dietary fiber and the lower risk of breast cancer,' Cade said. 'But earlier studies didn't draw any distinction between pre- and post-menopausal women.' According to the study's authors, there are three possible reasons for the anti-cancer effects of a high fiber diet: First, fiber has a stabilizing effect on the body's insulin levels. High insulin levels have been shown to contribute to the risk of cancer. Second, high-fiber foods also tend to be rich in other essential nutrients, including those with antioxidant properties. Third, and perhaps most relevant, dietary fiber reduces the levels of estrogen in the body, which has been shown to correlate with the risk of breast cancer. These levels are higher in younger women, which may explain the age split that researchers discovered. According to the study, pre-menopausal women should eat at least 30 grams of fiber per day to reduce their cancer risk. By contrast, the American Dietetic Association recommends a minimum of 25 grams per day for a 2,000-calorie diet. Breast cancer is the second most fatal cancer among women, after lung cancer. Between one in 13 and one in nine women will contract it at some point in their lives. The study was funded by the World Cancer Research Fund and published in the International Journal of Epidemiology. ### ",4
3," The White House has been caught in yet another lie, and one that it's repeated enough times now that there's no excusing it as just another careless faux pas. Desperate to defend its continued funding of abortion mill Planned Parenthood, the Obama regime is now claiming that this illicit baby chop-shop organization needs your tax dollars to continue providing mammograms to women, a service that it admittedly doesn't even offer . That's right -- Obama and Co. wants Americans to believe that Planned Parenthood requires some half-a-million in taxpayer dollars annually to continue providing breast cancer screenings to women, even though Planned Parenthood doesn't, nor has it ever, offered breast cancer screenings to women . Obama's Secretary of Health and Human Services Sylvia Mathews Burwell blatantly lied to the American public when she stated the following during a recent meeting with the House Education and Workforce Committee. 'What I think is important is that our HHS funding is focused on issues of preventative care for women, things like mammograms,' she's quoted as saying. Obama regime continues to lie about Planned Parenthood offering mammograms More important than what Burwell thinks in her deluded mind, though, are the actual facts -- that Planned Parenthood doesn't offer mammograms . Planned Parenthood's supposed 'preventative' services for breast cancer are a complete fabrication intended to persuade feeble minds into thinking, 'Yeah, they're murdering babies and selling their body parts. But think about the women!' Obama himself made the same false claim back in 2012 while on the campaign trail, alleging that 'millions' of women receive mammograms from Planned Parenthood every year. In reality, the actual number of women who receive mammograms from Planned Parenthood every year is precisely zero, as admitted by even the left-leaning Washington Post (WP). 'The problem here is that Planned Parenthood does not perform mammograms or even possess the necessary equipment to do so,' a resident fact-checker at WP admitted, defying the White House lie that the nation's largest abortion provider is in any way concerned with protecting women against breast cancer . 'As such, the organization certainly does not 'provide' mammograms in the strict sense. Instead, its clinics provide referrals and direct low-income women toward resources to help pay for the procedure. These services are by no means unique to Planned Parenthood. In fact, the Susan G. Komen Foundation and the American Cancer Society provide them, as well.' Obama's legacy of lies to be marked by administration's defense of genocide for profit It's all par for the course for Obama's delinquent legacy, it seems -- lie after lie after lie, with some of these lies being the same lies repeated over and over and over again. The White House is even now lying about the undercover videos released by the Center for Medical Progress (CMP), which clearly and undeniably expose Planned Parenthood for illegally selling aborted baby parts for profit. White House Press Secretary Josh Earnest recently told the media that these videos are somehow 'fraudulent,' even though they contain hours of footage from Planned Parenthood officials and doctors openly talking about extracting aborted babies in a way that avoids 'crushing' them so their body parts can be illegally sold to the highest bidder. 'Watch the videos for yourselves,' encourages Michelle Malkin, writing for CNSNews.com. 'Get the facts. Unmask the lies.' 'The cackling profiteers of Planned Parenthood don't care about your breasts. They're too busy putting price tags on the baby hearts, livers, lungs and limbs swirling around in bloody pie plates, stacked in their 'research' labs, subsidized with your tax dollars and sold to the highest bidders. For 'preventative care,' of course.' Read more stories about what Planned Parenthood is really doing at Abortions.news Also, read the truth about Margaret Sanger at TruthWiki.org ",2
3," Past research bodies have confirmed the health-protective effect of a natural diet rich in flavonoids to protect against a wide range of diseases including heart disease, hypertension, some cancers, and dementia. Researchers from Harvard University and the University of East Anglia have published the result of a study in the journal Neurology that demonstrates how these plant-based phytonutrients can significantly lower the risk of developing Parkinson's disease, especially in men. Flavonoids from healthy foods such as berries, tea, apples, and red wine cross the delicate blood-brain barrier to protect neurons against neurologic diseases such as Parkinson's. This large scale study included more than 130,000 men and women participants that were followed for a period of twenty years. During this time, more than 800 individuals developed Parkinson's disease. A diet high in flavonoids from berries lowers Parkinson's disease risk by forty percent After a detailed analysis of their diets and adjusting for age and lifestyle, male participants who ate the most flavonoids were shown to be forty percent less likely to develop the disease than those who ate the least. No similar link was found for total flavonoid intake in women. Co-lead study author, Dr. Aedin Cassidy noted 'These exciting findings provide further confirmation that regular consumption of flavonoids can have potential health benefits.' This was the first study to examine the connection between flavonoid consumption and the development of Parkinson's disease. The findings suggest that a sub-class of flavonoids called anthocyanins may exhibit neuroprotective effects. Participants consuming one or more portions of berry fruits each week were around twenty-five percent less likely to develop Parkinson's disease, relative to those who did not eat berry fruits.Flavonoids are the bioactive, naturally occurring chemical compounds found in many plant-based foods and drinks. This study demonstrated the main protective effect was from the consumption of anthocyanins, which are present in berries and other fruits and vegetables including aubergines, blackcurrants, and blackberries. Strawberries and blueberries are the two most common sources of flavonoids in the US diet, contributing to a twenty-four percent lowered risk in this research. Parkinson's disease is among a group of chronic diseases presently affecting one in 500 people, with new cases on the rise. Drug therapies are ineffective and bear significant side effects. The result of this study provides yet another example of the power of a natural diet in the prevention of many debilitating and deadly conditions. Nutrition experts recommend adding a minimum of three to five servings of flavonoids to your diet each week. Include all varieties of berries, apples, and green tea to guard against Parkinson's disease and other neurodegenerative illnesses. ",4
3," A report recently published in the American Journal of Clinical Nutrition found that black women who consume fried chicken or fast food burgers at least twice a week are between 40 and 70 percent more prone to develop type 2 diabetes over the course of a decade than those who do not. Not only black women but all people who consume high calorie, low nutrient fast foods on even a moderate basis are susceptible to developing the disease. Dr. Julie Palmer and her colleagues from Boston University analyzed over 44,000 black women who were instructed to complete questionnaires that they were given beginning back in 1995. Once concluded, researchers compared the results with another group of women who claimed never to eat fast food. The result was that not only were the women who ate fast food more likely to develop type 2 diabetes than the non-fast food group, they also were generally heavier with many falling into the overweight range. The standard measuring tool for determining healthy body weight is the Body Mass Index (BMI). A healthy BMI is somewhere between 18.5 and 24.9. Most of the participants in the fast food group were somewhere between 28 and 29 when they started the study, which according the U.S. Centers for Disease Control (CDC) is overweight. Those in this group also continued to gain more weight during the course of the study. Interestingly, the two foods that played the largest role in blood sugar disorder were fast food hamburgers and fried chicken. These foods were implicated in causing the most weight gain which resulted in more cases of diabetes . Nearly 3,000 women in the fast food eating group developed type 2 diabetes by the time the study concluded. A previous fast food study conducted in 2004 by researchers from Boston Children's Hospital found similar results. After tracking more than 3,000 young adults for over 15 years, researchers found that people who ate at fast food restaurants more than twice a week gained an average of almost 10 pounds more than those who went only once a week. The twice a week group also had a 200 percent increase in insulin resistance compared to the once a week group. Experts also concluded that those who ate the most fast food lived the most unhealthy lifestyles in general and were the most prone to developing other serious diseases throughout the course of their lives. While some experts suggest consuming smaller portion sizes and less overall calories, a better option would be to make better food choices. Eating less fast food is good, but changing one's lifestyle to include whole, living foods is even better.

3," After struggling to maintain its image following a barrage of product recalls and safety scares, Johnson & Johnson (J&J;) has announced that it plans to reformulate not only its entire line of children's personal care products, but also many of its adult personal care products, to remove a number of chemicals and chemical byproducts that have been the topic of public concern in recent years. By 2015, virtually all J&J; consumer care products will be free of preservative chemicals that release methylene glycol, the alcohol form of formaldehyde, which has been identified as a cancer-causing agent. J&J; also plans to remove preservative chemicals that produce 1,4 dioxane, a chemical also linked to causing cancer. ( http://www.selfnews.com/028846_laundry_detergents_dioxane.html ) 'There's a very lively public discussion going on about the safety of ingredients in personal care products, (and) it was really important that we had a voice in that,' said Susan Nettesheim, J&J;'s Vice President for Product Stewardship. Though Nettesheim insists that the existing chemicals used in J&J; products are safe, she also says her company is trying to respond to the concerns of its customers. J&J; has even created a website dedicated to this transition to new product formulations, many of which will take place even sooner than 2015, at least in products designed for children and babies. The site, entitled Our Safety & Care Commitment , explains how the company will eventually phase out phthalates, triclosan, parabens, fragrances, and many other questionable chemicals from its product lines in years to come. 'We've never really seen a major personal care product company take the kind of move that they're taking with this,' said Kenneth A. Cook, President of the Environmental Working Group (EWG), about J&J;'s decision to be an industry leader in this particular area. Cook even expressed a bit of surprise that a company as large as J&J; has decided to take on the incredible, and quite costly, task of reformulating even its signature formulas, to which many people have grown accustomed. In the process of phasing out its questionable ingredients, J&J; says it plans to conduct extensive research on potential alternative ingredients to ensure their safety. When all is said and done, only a few J&J; products will still contain trace levels of formaldehyde and 1,4 dioxane, as well as certain fragrance chemicals. Most J&J; products; however, will eventually be free of phthalates, triclosan, parabens, and formaldehyde. 'We want to share our policies and plans in a forum that is designed to help consumers better understand what we do to ensure that the products they choose are as safe as can be,' added Nettesheim.

3," The advance of robotics in recent years has been incredible and is now about to enter a new era, according to reports. Indeed, 'humanoid' types of robots are expected to hit American retailers sometime next year. Bloomberg News reports that billionaire Masayoshi Son will begin selling a kind of humanoid robot named 'Pepper' by summer 2015 at Sprint Corp. stories in the United States, which is part of a push by SoftBank Corp. to move the technology beyond the factory. In addition, SoftBank says it has received nearly 400 inquiries about its humanoid robot from companies in finance, food service and education, said Fumihide Tomizawa, chief executive officer of SoftBank Robotics, in an interview with Bloomberg News . The 1.2-meter (4-foot) robot 'dances, makes jokes and estimates human emotions based on expressions,' the news service reported. Pepper will be on sale in Japan in February for about $1,900; the company has yet to set a price for it in the U.S. 'We want to build a society that coexists with robots' Last year, SoftBank paid $22 billion for control of Sprint; now, the company has begun to invest in robotics as Japan looks to double the value of its current domestic production to 2.41 trillion yen ($22.9 billion) by 2020. The company has developed an operating system that can control robots much the same as Google's Android software can run a smartphone. Its platform is able to be customized so it can be used in a range of industries including construction, healthcare and entertainment. 'We will sell Pepper in the United States within a year after gathering information in Japan,' Tomizawa told Bloomberg News . 'I won't be surprised if Pepper sales will be half to business and half to consumers.' In July, SoftBank Robotics was launched as a subsidiary to direct the company's business and begin selling Pepper; the robot comes equipped with a laser sensor and a battery that can last up to 12 hours. As further reported by Bloomberg News : The robot was initially targeted at families and the elderly before getting attention for business use since its June unveiling. Tomizawa declined to specify the company's sales targets for robotics. SoftBank expects to generate revenue through applications and original content as customers personalize their robots. 'The basic premise is to produce profit,' Tomizawa said. 'Son is aggressively involved in the project and we report to him one or two times a month.' In 2010, Son described his vision for the future: Create a society where humans coexist with intelligent robots. He has also said that Pepper is a result of time he has spent watching the television show Astro Boy , a cartoon series in the 1960s based on a character who could not experience emotions. In July, Son said he believes that he can improve labor productivity by replacing 90 million jobs with one-third as many robots. 'We could enter the robot business for industrial use in the mid or long term,' Tomizawa explained. China ramping up production too SoftBank's robot development coincides with robotics companies acquired recently by Google, including Schaft Inc., a Tokyo-based company that manufactures two-legged humanoid robots . Other robot firms include Honda Motor Co., which has developed a robot that plays soccer, and Panasonic Corp. Meanwhile, in neighboring China, robotics production is ramping up as well. According to China's state-run Xinhua News Agency, the country's first industrial robot line should begin operation this month in the northeastern city of Shenyang, officials said. The Saisun Robot and Automation Co. Ltd. 'will be the first to jump start China's industrial robot production with an annual capacity of 5,000,' the news agency reported. In 2013, China became the world's largest industrial robot market, with 37,000 units sold. That was 20 percent of the global market.

3," I'm a Navy veteran who served a four year enlistment from 1979-1983. I was 17 when I signed up and turned 18 the day I completed boot-camp. I was trained as an Aviation Electrician. After all my schooling was completed I was assigned to helicopter squadron HSL-33. It was a unique squadron because the helicopters were not used on aircraft carriers or other aircraft oriented ships but rather a relatively small ship called a'Fast Frigate'. They named this type of detachment 'LAMPS' The ships were modified to accommodate a single helicopter. In 1982 I was part of the aviation detachment to the USS Lockwood. The ship was froward deployed which meant it's home-port was outside the United States. The USS Lockwood's home-port was Japan. It was a very memorable experience. I visited fascinating Oriental countries and gained a valuable insight into how different the rest of the world is from America. There was one day that will always remain the most memorable of all. The USS Lockwood was about 100 miles off the coast of Thailand. We encountered an incredible sight. A small boat crammed with people. It was a mix of men,women and children. The boat was in bad shape and it was loaded beyond the weight limits intend for it and barely able to keep from taking on water. Our ship stopped and pulled along side. I was on topside and witnessed the whole event. As the small craft drifted closer to the ship you could see the desperation in their faces. Soon we were informed that these people were refugees making a very dangerous attempt to flee Vietnam and make it to Thailand . Even as late as 1982 the aftermath of the Vietnam War was still destroying the lives of the people of Vietnam. Another announcement came stating that the refugees were out of water, food, and fuel. They would of never made it to Thailand still about 100 hundred miles away. The announcement was made by the Executive Officer. He continued, 'we will give them the supplies they need and send them on their way.' The reaction was immediate among the crew, we were stunned. Even with supplies and fuel the odds were against them ever making it to Thailand . Then something unexpected happened. A few minutes after that announcement the Captain of the USS Lockwood made this announcement, 'in order to avoid a mutiny we are going to give these refugees a ride to Thailand.' High fives and smiles were to be seen everywhere I looked. We took them aboard and the crew used the ship's only gun near the bow to sink the abandoned boat. That's done to prevent it from being a possible danger to other ships passing through the area. A few hours later we came across another boat of Vietnamese refugees. There were no more announcements the ship picked up those desperate people too. When I think back on that day a number of thoughts come to mind. How many of those small boats with desperate refugees didn't make it to Thailand? I wonder what happened to the refugees we saved? The USS Lockwood was given a Humanitarian Award. We wore a ribbon on our uniforms for the actions taken that day. I'm proud of the attitude of my fellow shipmates they instinctively wanted to help those people. I'm proud I served on a ship with a compassionate Captain that overruled his Executive Officer. His remarks about a mutiny were tongue-in-cheek, there was no danger of that happening. He knew however, it would damage ship morale. I'm grateful the Captain allowed his crew to be the good Americans that day.

3," Once again, employees of the nation's most worthless federal agency, the Transportation Security Administration, are in trouble with the law for allegedly committing a sexually abusive act against a passenger. According to the local CBS affiliate, Denver police have launched a sexual assault investigation against TSA screeners who work at a checkpoint at the Denver International Airport. The report says the investigation began recently, after a Colorado woman filed a complaint, saying a pat-down and frisk she received there was akin to sexual assault. 'It's an open and active investigation,' Denver police spokesperson Sonny Jackson said. 'We take all complaints seriously and we are on this case as well. We have launched an investigation into it.' As reported by CBS4 : The criminal probe stems from a complaint filed by Jamelyn Steenhoek, 39, who was patted down by TSA agents on Dec. 26 as she was escorting her 13-year-old daughter to a flight bound for Philadelphia. Steenhoek was not flying, just getting her daughter to the gate. 'I feel like someone who works for a powerful agency that we are afraid of used their power to violate me sexually - to put me in my place,' Steenhoek, a full-time college student and a working mother for a county social services department, told the local station. After finding nothing, the agent repeated the groping Though she had proper credentials to escort her daughter to the airline gate, an alarm sounded at the TSA checkpoint when she passed through. The humiliated mother said she believes the checkpoint metal detector sounded after picking up jewels that were sewn into the rear pockets of her blue jeans. When the alarm sounded, TSA agents at the checkpoint asked if she would agree to have her hands swabbed, which she did. 'Then they told me I tested positive for explosives,' Steenhoek said, adding that she told the agents that the positive probably stemmed from earlier in the day when she had pumped gas into her vehicle. 'She said, 'We'll have to do a search.' So I thought, 'Okay,'' Steenhoek said. Steenhoek told the station she was focused on simply getting the search over with and getting to the gate with her daughter, with enough time to spare in order to get the daughter a bite to eat before her flight departed. She said she was then ushered away to a small private room at the checkpoint, with her daughter watching from a few feet away. 'They told me to spread my arms and spread my feet,' Steenhoek said, noting that the female TSA agent conducting the search appeared to become agitated as Steenhoek tried to hurry the process along - so she could get her child to her gate. 'At that point she did a pretty invasive search,' she said. 'They are just areas of the body I'm not comfortable being touched in. On the outside of my pants she cupped my crotch. I was uncomfortable with that.' The embarrassed mother also said the TSA agent repeatedly dug her fingers into Steenhoek's armpits as well. 'The part of the search that bothered most was the breast search,' she explained. 'You could tell it shouldn't take that much groping. To me it was as extensive as an exam from my physician - full touching and grabbing in the front. I felt uncomfortable, I felt violated.' 'You want one or more of them to be charged?' Worse, though the initial invasive search turned up nothing, the agent nevertheless repeated the procedure. 'So it didn't make any sense. The whole search was done over and more touching and grabbing than the first time,' Steenhoek said. Finally, the Gestapo - er, I mean, the TSA agent - released Steenhoek without finding anything suspicious, dangerous or prohibited. She managed to get her daughter to her gate on time. Steenhoek said she made a complaint to TSA management about her treatment, but like so many abused Americans before her, she didn't believe she was going to get any satisfaction. So, three days later, she went to the Denver Police Department and filed a complaint against the as-yet-unnamed female TSA agent who conducted the search. 'I was looking for consequences, for TSA to be accountable for what they do to people,' Steenhoek told CBS4 . 'You want one or more of them to be charged with sexual assault ?' she said she was asked. 'I do,' Steenhoek responded. Police officials say they will submit the complaint to the district attorney, to see if there is enough evidence to file charges. As often as this kind of nonsense has happened already, I'm not holding my breath that anyone at the TSA will be held to account.

3," The cancer industry has apparently become so desperate to recruit new customers that it is now resorting to what can only be described as a type of medical date rape. A number of hospitals and cancer centers across the country are reportedly now holding community-driven 'mammogram parties,' a deceptive cancer marketing scheme that basically entails deliberately getting women tipsy or drunk on alcohol with their friends and neighbors in order to entice them into getting medically molested via mammograms. The horrendous bait and switch tactic is taking place under the guise of 'saving lives,' as it is specifically designed for women who feel uncomfortable with getting mammograms, and who would otherwise avoid getting them if it were not for the added pressure of being wined and dined in a comfortable and relaxing environment. Women are being encouraged to 'grab their girlfriends' for a night out at the local cancer center, during which time they take turns getting blasted with ionizing radiation in between munching down fancy cheeses and chocolate fondue, and sipping down delectable wine. 'It may be a good way to improve compliance and make having a mammogram more enjoyable,' claimed Dr. Julie Silver, an assistant professor at Harvard Medical School , to ABC News about the disturbing mammogram party phenomenon. Are mammogram parties an organized form of medical date rape? It is interesting that Dr. Silver would use the word 'compliance' in conjunction with mammograms, as the word is generally used in reference to someone giving an order or command to do something. This, combined with the fact that cancer centers which hold 'mamm' parties are basically having to induce inebriation in order to convince many women to get mammograms, shows how slyly coercive the cancer industry is becoming in its quest to recruit new cancer patients. With thousands of women waking up to the fact that mammograms are much more dangerous than we are all being told, and a cause of cancer in and of themselves, it is hardly surprising that the cancer industry has sunk to unconscionable new lows. And yet at the very same time, getting women drunk in order to compress their breasts for a radiation screening is technically a form of rape, or at the very least, molestation with alcohol and ambiance representing the date rape drugs of choice. Even worse is the fact that many insurance companies are now covering the costs associated with holding mamm parties, which include not only food and beverage costs, but also all the massages and other luxurious spa resort amenities that increasingly characterize many of the gatherings. Whatever it takes to get women to subject themselves to radiation blasts is fair game, in other words, and it appears as though the specious strategy is quite a success. 'I am having fun,' explained one woman attending a recent mamm party in Nevada to KTVN Channel 2 News in Reno. 'Way better than the last time I came here and had [a mammogram]. This time it didn't hurt. Maybe it was the glass of wine I had before I went.' ",1
3," Analysts and experts have long maintained that the duration of the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan are having a detrimental effect on the nation's military personnel. Nowhere have the problems of high operational tempos and repeated combat deployments manifested themselves more than in the tens of thousands of soldiers and others who are increasingly being medicated in order to deal with the stress. In fact, according to recent figures released by the Army's surgeon general, more than 110,000 U.S. Army personnel were taking antidepressants, narcotics, sedatives, antipsychotics and anti-anxiety drugs that were prescribed to them by doctors. With a renewed focus on individual soldier readiness by the Pentagon after a decade of war, it should trouble Defense Department officials - civilians and top officers alike - that nearly 8 percent of active duty Army troops are on sedatives, and another 6 percent are on antidepressants, figures that are up eightfold since 2005. So many psychotropic drug prescriptions are having an effect on more than just readiness, but also on legal issues affecting military members. 'In a small but growing number of cases across the nation, lawyers are blaming the U.S. military's heavy use of psychotropic drugs for their clients' aberrant behavior and related health problems,' The Los Angeles Times reported in early April. See the selfnews infographic on the psychiatric drugging of soldiers at: http://www.selfnews.com The problem is bad and getting worse Bart Billings, a former military psychologist who hosts an annual conference on combat stress, said the problem is real and it's growing. 'We have never medicated our troops to the extent we are doing now.... And I don't believe the current increase in suicides and homicides in the military is a coincidence,' he told the paper. Indeed, the Army suicide rate fell for the first time in four years in 2011, the result of aggressive service-wide efforts to identify those having problems early-on. But the rate is still high. It's about 24 per 100,000 last year, which is higher than a similar demographic among civilians, about 19 per 100,000. Among veterans of Iraq and Afghanistan, that rate is even higher - about 38 per 100,000. Other problems are increasing too. 'Sexual assault and domestic violence have increased. The percentage of soldiers committing sex crimes has increased 32 percent since 2006,' USA Today reported. 'The number of domestic abusers in the Army grew by almost 50 percent from 4,827 in 2008 to 7,228 last year. During that same, the number of child-abuse offenders is up 62 percent from 3,172 to 5,149.' Too many meds, too little control Clearly, the up-tempo has had a negative effect on our fighting force. But making excuses or explaining away the phenomenon is denial, and it's not going to help the Pentagon and Congress solve the problem. 'It's not that we're using them more frequently or any differently,' said Col. Carol Labadie, the pharmacy consultant for the Army surgeon general. 'As with any medication, you have to look at weighing the risk versus the benefits of somebody going on a medication.' Experts say the problem isn't necessarily in the numbers. It's that you can't regulate the use of such medications in the military as easily as you can in the civilian world. Follow-up appointments, for example, are few and far between - especially on the battlefield. And soldiers are often sent out into combat zones with six months' worth of medications, enough to trade with their buddies or grab a fistful of pills at the end of a particularly stressful day or mission. Soldiers who have been wounded can easily become addicted to painkillers they are given. 'The big difference is these are people who have access to loaded weapons, or have responsibility for protecting other individuals who are in harm's way,' Grace Jackson, a former Navy staff psychiatrist who resigned her commission in 2002 in part out of concern that military shrinks were handing out too many medications, told the Times. The problem has begun to show up in court, where, increasingly, lawyers for military members on meds have begun to argue - successfully - that the psychotropic drug made them do it. James Culp, a former Army paratrooper who has since become a high-profile military defense lawyer, says he's recently defended an Army private accused of murder. His defense? The soldier's mental condition was exacerbated by the Zoloft he was prescribed. 'What do you do when 30-80 percent of the people that you have in the military have gone on three or more deployments, and they are mentally worn out? What do you do when they can't sleep? You make a calculated risk in prescribing these medications,' Culp told the paper. ",4
3," Artificially sweetened drinks are often promoted as healthy alternatives for weight loss and diabetes because they are low in calories and don't contain sugar. However, there is plenty of evidence to suggest that these diet sodas are harmful to human health. According to Sharon Fowler, MPH, an authority on this subject, 'Diet soda is not a health food. In fact, it's not a food at all, it's simply a slurry of chemicals, a number of which may have deleterious effects on the body.' Most recently diet sodas have been tied to increased risk of stroke and heart attack, and while many people drink them as an aid to weight reduction, research suggests if you drink diet soda, weight gain may be the result instead. Weight gain In one study linking diet beverages to weight gain, Hazuda, et. al. at the University of Texas Health Science Center in San Antonio, recorded changes in waist circumferences in 474 elderly participants in a 10-year study. As part of the study they controlled for diabetes, physical activity, neighborhood, age, sex and ethnicity. Findings showed that increases in waist sizes were 70 percent greater among those who drank diet soft drinks compared with those who did not. In addition, waist size increases were as much as 500 percent greater amongst those that drank two or more diet sodas a day. In other research, Sharon Fowler and colleagues studied eight years of data based on individuals between 25 and 64. Of the study participants who were of normal weight in the beginning, a third were overweight or obese eight years later. In evaluating the correlation between obesity and diet drinks researchers found that every bottle of diet soda participants drank in a day raised their obesity risk by 41 percent. Diabetes Aspartame, a common sweetener in diet beverages, has also been linked to diabetes. In an animal study conducted at UT San Antonio, researchers fed corn oil-enriched feed to one group of mice and the same feed plus aspartame to another group. Three months later the aspartame group had elevated glucose levels but insulin levels that were equal to or less than those of the control group, suggesting that aspartame may be part of the connection between diet soda consumption and diabetes. Corrupted Signals What is the reason for the diet soda weight gain connection? One theory is that our bodies rely on a signaling system based on the quality of the foods we eat. In the case of diet soda , the body experiences a sweet taste and expects calories; but when they aren't forthcoming starts to crave food, which leads to overeating. Psychologists at Purdue University tested this idea by comparing two groups of rats, one which was fed yogurt with sugar and one which was fed yogurt with saccharine. The saccharine rats ate significantly more calories, gained more weight and put on more body fat than the control group. Sweet Cravings Still another possibility is that eating sweets dulls our taste buds causing us to eat more sugary foods in compensation. Some 2011 research in the UK seems to support this idea. The scientists found that consumption of two cans of soda a day for a month resulted in a noticeable dulling of taste buds and increased cravings for high calorie foods. Since artificial sweeteners (which were not part of this particular study) are 200 to 300 times sweeter than sugar, it is at least possible that they may have a similar impact on our taste buds. ",4
3," Mothers who exercise more during pregnancy may give birth to children with higher IQs, according to psychologist Richard E. Nisbett, author of Intelligence and How to Get It . 'Children whose mother exercised 30 minutes a day score around eight points higher on standard IQ tests than children whose mothers were more sedentary,' he said. The Western medical profession once believed that exercise after the first trimester of pregnancy might place the fetus at risk, but new research is increasingly discrediting this idea. The British government recommends that women remain active throughout pregnancy, noting that the more active a woman is, the easier it will be for her body to adapt to the experience of pregnancy and the easier her labor will be. Running, stretching and using light weights are among the exercises that many pregnant women can do easily. 'Exercising large muscle groups increases the growth of neurons and adds to the blood supply of the brain,' Nisbett writes. A woman who exercises during pregnancy and also breastfeeds for at least nine months will raise her child's IQ an average of 14 points, he said. Nisbett says that the way parents interact with their children can also help boost their IQ. He encourages parents to ask their children questions that they already know the answer to, and to explain how they know. This helps children develop the ability to find the answers to their own questions. He also encourages the practice of 'anticipation exercises,' games in which parents encourage children to predict future events, such as where a submerged animal will emerge from the water. Research suggests that mothers are the most important influences in their children's intellectual development, he said, but that fathers contribute relatively little. 'The mother is the most important IQ agent here,' he said. 'In families dominated by a father, there are higher mathematical skills but that's all we contribute, I'm afraid.'

3," Tweet Hundreds of years ago, the forefathers of modern medicine performed live dissections on monkeys and other animals, peeling away layers of skin and muscle to observe the operating organs deep inside. The screams and cries of the animals were thought to be just reflexes. Today, it's common sense that all mammals feel and experience pain, but it has also been long believed that fish and other forms of animal life don't. Fishing isn't cruel, sportsmen have argued, because the fish don't have the brain power to really experience pain. New research demolishes that flawed belief. Fish do feel and experience pain. They may not be as smart as primates, but they're not so stupid that they can't feel a hook ripping their digestive organs out through their mouths. Naturally, sportsmen are screaming bloody murder at this. Or, actually, they're screaming that fishing is not bloody murder. It's just an innocent sport, something you do with the family. Something you do to bond with nature. Hunters cite the exact same arguments. 'Deer don't feel any pain,' they insist. Although, in truth, it takes a rather imaginative distortion of reality to insist that a mammal running through the woods, leaving a trail of fresh blood two miles long, somehow didn't feel anything. In time, as additional research like this emerges, more people will begin to ask the important question: 'Why is maiming animals for entertainment still legal in a civilized society?' Analysis: Fish feel pain. Fishermen disagree. Expect to see more people questioning the 'sports' of fishing and hunting as more research like this emerges. ",1
3," It has been noted that one of the most popular requests in wellness stores is for products to help ease stomach pain naturally. People, from cancer patients to parents of babies suffering from colic, try to look for the safest and most effective way of dealing with stomach pain. There is actually no natural cure that will aid all types of stomach pain, but if the pain has been persisting for some time, you need the help of a doctor. For simple pains due to menstrual cramps or the ingestion of food that is already spoiled, there are many natural alternatives to make the stomach calm down. Natural Stomach Pain Killers Here's a rundown of 12 home and herbal remedies that can help soothe various types of belly discomfort: 1. Ginger Ginger is known to possess anti-inflammatory properties plus other benefits. This also helps in easing stomach pains, as well as aiding in digestion. One can take this by peeling and grating the ginger and making a tea out of it. For people who do not like spicy foods, ginger supplements may be better, as ginger can be a bit spicy. It is better to make a tea out of fresh ginger than to buy ginger ale, as the latter is already full of sugar. Conventional sugar can further aggravate stomach pain. 2. Fennel or licorice These are similar in taste even though they come from different plants. These have a taste that not all people like, so if one does not like the taste, it is best to settle with other alternatives. Fennel and licorice are found in a lot of herbal teas, as well as supplements. To those who are alright with the taste, chewing a fresh slice (bulb) can ease stomach pain . 3. Chamomile Chamomile doesn't only calm one's nerves but also soothes a painful stomach. People can take chamomile tea for upset stomachs. For additional flavor, lemon can be added to the tea. 4. Peppermint Mint, similar to ginger, should be taken fresh in order to settle an upset stomach . Simply take a few sprigs of mint and put them in a cup of warm water. Chewing on a leaf can also help. 5. Lemon water To those who have no ginger, licorice, mint or fennel at home, squeezing half of a lemon into a mug with warm water can help soothe the stomach too. 6. Baking soda Antacids that are sold in the market typically have sodium bicarbonate, otherwise known as baking soda. People can simply take a teaspoon or two and mix it into a mug of warm water. This is as good as taking Alka-Seltzer to get rid of indigestion or heartburn. 7. Warm salt water Salt water is good for sore throats as well as upset stomachs. A teaspoon of salt mixed in a cup of warm water will surely do the trick. In order to get the best results, it is recommended to drink the water as fast as one can. 8. Warm rice compress Heat is known as one of the best methods to soothe an upset stomach, especially when it comes to cramps. To those who have no heating pads at home, they can make one out of an old sock plus some uncooked rice. Place it inside the microwave for a minute and use on the affected area. 9. Burned toast Charcoal is popular in the hospital for cases of alcohol or food poisoning, as it helps to neutralize the poison in the body. Burnt toast is commonly used to treat children with stomachaches or diarrhea, so too are bananas, rice and applesauce (BRAT). 10. Cola syrup This has been used for a long time to treat upset stomachs. Cola syrup has been deemed safe for children, as well as delicious. 11. Apple cider vinegar This vinegar is said to be very beneficial to the body. A few teaspoons mixed in a glass of warm or cold water can help alleviate the pain . 12. Aloe vera juice People who have intestinal problems have reported that this juice is very helpful. It can help get rid of cramps, gas, diarrhea and bloating. These are 12 popular remedies to help treat stomach pain. However, if the pain is persistent even with the use of these remedies, immediate medical help should be sought. ",4
3," Study after study continues to show that eating broccoli helps to prevent and treat cancer. And a new study out of the University of Illinois (U of I) says that combining broccoli with broccoli sprouts nearly doubles the cruciferous vegetable's anti-cancer effects. 'Broccoli, prepared correctly, is an extremely potent cancer-fighting agent -- three to five servings a week are enough to have an effect,' said Elizabeth Jeffery, a U of I professor of nutrition that worked on the study. 'To get broccoli's benefits, though, the enzyme myrosinase has to be present; if it's not there, sulforaphane, broccoli's cancer-preventive and anti-inflammatory component, doesn't form.' Previous research on the cancer-preventing benefits of broccoli have found that overcooking broccoli results in the elimination of up to 90 percent of the vegetable's anti-cancer compounds. ( http://www.selfnews.com/025893_broccoli_s... ). However, gently cooking broccoli in a steamer, not in the microwave, can potentially unlock more of its anti-cancer compounds than are present when eating the vegetable raw. Jeffrey and her colleagues compared blood levels of sulforaphane among a group of men who ate meals containing either broccoli sprouts alone, broccoli powder alone, or both combined. They found that in just three hours after finishing their meals, participants who ate both the powder and the sprouts had nearly twice as much of the anti-cancer substance in their systems than the two other groups did. 'There was almost a twofold increase in sulforaphane absorption when sprouts and powder were eaten together,' said Jeffrey. 'It changed the way the subjects metabolized the powder. We saw plasma and urine metabolites much earlier and at much higher levels than when either was eaten alone.' Jeffrey and her team say that combining other sulforaphane-rich foods like mustard, radishes, arugula, and wasabi, along with broccoli and broccoli sprouts, will increase the benefits even further. But she warns that taking certain broccoli supplements in lieu of actual broccoli and broccoli sprouts may not work, as some broccoli supplements do not contain the vital enzyme myrosinase that produces sulforaphane.

3," Heart disease and stroke continues to rank as the leading, preventable cause of death in most Western societies, killing three-quarters of a million people combined. Any natural compound that can significantly lower the death rate from vascular diseases should be embraced by natural health advocates and the medical profession alike. Yet allopathic physicians continue to prescribe a host of ineffective and dangerous prescription medications that do little to combat this epidemic. The result of a study published in the British Medical Journal shows that dark chocolate consumption can reduce cardiovascular events, such as heart attack and stroke, in people with metabolic syndrome (physical biomarkers that significantly increase the risk of developing heart disease and diabetes). Past studies have suggested that eating small amounts of dark chocolate (containing at least 60 percent cocoa solids) provides short-term heart protective effects. Australian researchers wanted to further determine if dark chocolate could provide long term benefits in an at-risk population. Dark chocolate found to significantly lower non-fatal and fatal vascular events Scientists assembled a cohort of 2,013 participants with existing markers for heart disease (high blood pressure and metabolic syndrome), but were not presently on medications. The group ate dark chocolate daily (equivalent to one ounce or one square of chocolate) for a period of ten years. The investigators used sophisticated risk-prediction algorithms and population life tables to determine the probability of patients developing or dying from heart disease or other non-cardiovascular causes each year. The study demonstrated that those individuals following the dietary chocolate protocol with 100 percent compliance could potentially avert 70 non-fatal and 15 fatal cardiovascular events per 10,000 people treated over 10 years. It is important to note that these risk reduction numbers are higher than many deadly pharmaceutical interventions. At a reduced compliance rate of 80 percent, the scientists found the number of non-fatal and fatal events potentially averted was 55 and 10 per 10,000 people treated over 10 years, still considered to be an effective intervention strategy. The study team noted that the findings are only relevant when consuming dark chocolate with a minimum cocoa content between 60 to 70 percent (prior studies suggest eighty percent cocoa content). Milk chocolate consumption does not lower risk of stroke or heart disease due to the high sugar content and lack of healthy cocoa flavonoids. The researchers concluded that daily dark chocolate consumption 'could represent an effective and cost effective strategy for people with metabolic syndrome (and no diabetes).' Health-minded individuals, especially those at risk or with a familial history of vascular disease may want to consider eating one ounce of high-cocoa content dark chocolate each day to shield against stroke and cardiovascular disease.

3," The Obama administration, which regularly touts itself as a champion for minorities, is attempting to cheat thousands of Native Americans out of future compensation that is rightly theirs following a horrendously damaging toxic chemical spill in Colorado recently. The Washington Times reported that tribal leaders say the Obama Environmental Protection Agency is attempting to cheat Navajo Indians by convincing them to sign away rights to future claims following the agency's Gold King Mine disaster. These charges are only magnifying the White House's public relations problems following the toxic spill, which threatens to disrupt critical waterways in the Southwest for many years to come. Within days of the disaster, EPA officials began going door to door asking Navajos some of whom do not speak English as their primary language to sign a form offering to pay them some damages they have incurred from the spill so far. Signing the document waives any rights to return with new claims in the future if costs spiral higher than expected or if they encounter new, currently unforeseen fallout, Navajo President Russell Begaye told The Washington Times . 'It is underhanded. They're just trying to protect their pocketbook,' he told the paper in a telephone interview. Standard federal practice: Cheat those who have been wronged Begaye promised he would file suit on behalf of the Navajo Nation. He also said he suspected that the EPA was attempting to buy off as many of his people as possible now to ward off any larger settlement expenses in the future. As we previously reported , the toxic spill unleashed as much as three million gallons of heavily contaminated yellow-orange water into the Animas River, which feeds into the San Juan River and eventually the Colorado River. The tributaries provide water for cattle and crops in much of the Four Corners area, which is the nexus of Arizona, Colorado, New Mexico and Utah. The Navajo Nation encompasses a great deal of that area. While the EPA had not officially responded to a Times inquiry regarding the pending suit, the agency's chief, Gina McCarthy, described the spill as 'heartbreaking' at a press conference in Durango, Colorado. She pledged to work with tribal leaders to control and manage the spill. 'We want everything to be transparent,' she said, despite the fact that the agency grossly underestimated the size of the spill , initially claiming that only about one million gallons of toxic water had escaped through a breached dam. As for the EPA agents trolling the Navajo Nation for early settlements, McCarthy said they were merely following the regular federal claims process, which means that throughout the government, Uncle Sam's standard practice is to shortchange people who have been harmed by careless federal actions. 'May cause forfeiture of your rights' Some lawmakers have pledged to look into the process. Rep. Rob Bishop, R-Utah, chairman of the House Natural Resources Committee, said via a spokeswoman that his office has fielded complaints from Navajo Nation and that his panel plans to look into the entire disaster. 'Chairman Bishop is outraged at the reports that the EPA is asking tribal members to sacrifice their rights after EPA's ineptitude has potentially threatened their health and livelihoods,' spokeswoman Julia Bell Slingsby said. 'People are suffering because of EPA negligence, and yet the federal government's response is not to help, but to engage in grasping for legal cover before the full extent of damage is known to Navajo farmers.' Slingsby added that the EPA would severely punish any private party or corporation that attempted to do the same thing, and she demanded to know why the Department of the Interior which holds oversight over Native American affairs has yet to come to the tribes' aid. The Times further reported: The claim forms EPA officials were distributing on the Navajo reservation ask locals to estimate a dollar amount they can attribute to property damage, personal injury or wrongful death. The form warns that failing to total up the claim 'may cause forfeiture of your rights.' Sources include: WashingtonTimes.com selfnews.com HNGN.com ",4
3," Thank you to all those who voted in our selfnews 2016 Presidential poll! Donald Trump easily dominated the top spot, more than doubling the support for our second-place candidate, Rand Paul. Here are the results, followed by some surprising discussion points below: Donald Trump: 44.3% Rand Paul: 18.8% Bernie Sanders: 13.1% Ben Carson: 7.3% Ted Cruz: 7.3% Carly Fiorina: 3.4% No Answer: 2.3% Scott Walker: 1.5% Hillary Clinton: 1.5% Jeb Bush: 0.6% (These votes total 100.1% due to rounding adjustments.) Pleasantly surprised! What's truly astonishing to me -- and pleasantly surprising -- is that 97.9% of our readers rejected the two establishment candidates : Hillary Clinton and Jeb Bush. Bush got the fewest votes of all: just 0.6%, even losing out to 'no answer' votes! Hillary Clinton received an embarrassing 1.5% of the votes, indicating that selfnews readers are, indeed, well informed on the runaway criminality of the Clinton regime. All the top vote choices for selfnews readers -- Donald Trump, Rand Paul and Bernie Sanders -- are anti-establishment candidates at some level. Rand Paul, for example, openly opposes the totalitarian police state in America, and Bernie Sanders openly opposes the Wall Street bankster criminality that dominates our financial sector. Donald Trump, of course, opposes practically everything in Washington, which is why he's the #1 contender for dismantling our twisted, broken, corrupt system of bad government. (Actually, 'bad government' doesn't even begin to describe it. We're talking about 'CRIMINAL government' here.) As this poll reflects, people in America are sick and tired of the status quo in Washington. They're sick of the corruption, the tyranny, the lies, the pandering, the wasteful spending and the targeting of patriotic Americans by the IRS and other federal agencies. They want REAL change, and Donald Trump is the guy they see as being able to march into Washington and clean house. It's no coincidence that we acquired the domain Trump.news , where you can read real-time breaking news on Donald Trump every hour of the day. See FETCH.news for breaking news on other topics such as Hillary Clinton or the White House . Thank you for participating in our 2016 Presidential candidates survey! We'll re-run this survey in a few months to see where things might have shifted by then. It seems increasingly likely that Hillary Clinton will be out of the race by that time . By the way, I'm fully aware of the many selfnews readers who say this entire election is a charade, and that the powers that be will never allow Trump to become President because he would tear down too much of the corruption that's keeping all the bureaucrats in power. You may be right about that, but for the moment, I'm willing to give Donald Trump the benefit of the doubt and see how this plays out. One thing you might be forgetting on this point, by the way, is that Donald Trump is pro military , and the Pentagon has desperately wanted to replace Obama with someone who actually gives a damn about veterans and national defense.

3," If you plan on going to a teaching hospital for a test or elective procedure, here's a warning that could save your life: Stay away from the hospital in July. The reason? According to a new study headed by Dr. David Phillips and Gwendolyn Barker from the University of California, San Diego, fatal medication errors soar that month -- especially in teaching hospitals. The research team investigated the cause behind the so-called curious 'July Effect' that has long been noted to worsen the outcomes of patients being treated in teaching hospitals during the month of July. Phillips and Barker focused on 244,388 U.S. death certificates issued between 1979 and 2006 that listed fatal medication errors as the primary cause of death. Then they compared the number of deaths that occurred in July with the number of expected events in a given month for a given year. Next, they looked to see if there were any differences between deaths in and out of hospitals in July and in counties that had or lacked teaching hospitals. The research, which was just published in the Journal of General Internal Medicine , found a clear association between inexperienced physicians and deadly medical errors. Specifically, the spike in hospital deaths each year from medication mistakes (such as accidental overdoses, wrong drugs given, and accidents in the use of drugs during medical and surgical procedures) in July coincided exactly with the annual influx of thousands of rookie doctors who begin their medical residencies and take on responsibility for patient care that month. This July peak in fatal drug errors was seen only in counties with teaching hospitals. In fact, the greater the concentration of teaching hospitals in a region, the greater the July spike in deaths. This was no little insignificant blip in the number of fatal physician screw-ups, either. The number of July deaths from medication mistakes linked to new doctors was a full 10 percent higher than the expected level. 'Our findings provide fresh evidence for 1. re-evaluating responsibilities assigned to new residents; 2. increasing supervision of new residents; 3. increasing education concerned with medication safety,' the authors of the study concluded.

3," Eleven years of groundbreaking research and data analysis on hospitalized Medicare patients is to be presented at the 35th annual meeting of the Society for Medical Decision Making in Baltimore, Maryland. The analysis has found positive evidence showing how nutritional supplements effectively lower hospital readmission rates. This is big news for the American medical industry, primarily because Medicare patients are typically given prescription drugs instead of nutritional supplements. And that prescription drug system must not be working, for in the current Medicare system, one in five patients are readmitted to a hospital in the same year, costing American taxpayers estimates exceeding $17.5 billion. Affordable Care Act prompting something good? One provision of the Affordable Care Act imposes fines on hospitals whose patient readmission rates exceed national averages. Fines estimated around $227 million are projected to hit over 2,000 hospitals in the next year. The fine, currently at one percent, is set to double going into 2014, punishing those hospitals that can't get their Medicare readmission rates under control. This may pressure hospitals administrators to change their Medicare outpatient care completely, as health care professionals look for alternatives to help elderly patients recover. Instead of welcoming readmissions and collecting Medicare insurance funds, hospitals may actually be pushed to help their patients recover! Entirely new outpatient programs and follow-ups may birth, helping seniors get the nutrition and energy they need to avoid readmission. The most common medical readmission issues Medicare patients face are acute myocardial infarction and congestive heart failure. With the right nutritional outpatient care, these vascular problems could subside. If powerful nutritional supplements including the likes of chlorella, hawthorne, and flax seed were utilized, many patients wouldn't have to be readmitted. For example, if follow-up doctor visits encouraged dietary advice and the provision of organic whole food supplements , then patients could heal more efficiently by getting the right enzymes, probiotics, essential fatty acids, minerals and vitamins in their body. This is the best way to cut down on hospital readmission rates - real whole food nutrition. Nutritional supplements cutting down hospital readmission rates The new 11-year study provides clear evidence on how nutritional supplements effectively cut hospital readmission rates. The research, conducted from the University of Southern California and Stanford University, shows how oral nutritional supplements help hospitalized Medicare patients, reducing 30-day hospital readmission rates , lowering patients' length of stay and bringing down taxpayer medical costs.

3," At the time, it became one of the most conspiracy-theorized incidents since the assassination of President John F. Kennedy -- the downing of TWA Flight 800. In case you haven't heard the story, Flight 800 -- a Boeing 747-100 airliner - blew up and then crashed into the Atlantic Ocean near East Moriches, New York, on July 17, 1996, around 8:30 p.m. EST, 12 minutes after taking off from John F. Kennedy (irony!) International Airport on a scheduled flight to Rome, following a stopover in Paris. All 230 aboard were, of course, killed, making it the third-worst air disaster. The official version of events, according to the FBI and the National Transportation Safety Board, was that a center fuel tank in the plane exploded due to faulty wiring. But others weren't buying that. In fact, the initial FBI investigation worked off the assumption that the plane was brought down by a missile, and the NTSB's final report, which wasn't issued until more than four years later, mentioned as much. Six months after the plane crashed, the NTSB's chairman, Jim Hall, was quoted as saying, 'All three theories -- a bomb, a missile or mechanical failure -- remain.' That speculation was fed by eyewitness accounts of a sudden explosion preceded by trails of fire arcing upward in the sky. Former NTSB investigator Henry Hughes has said he believes that either a bomb or a missile brought the plane down . 'No, the expert is wrong' Hughes petitioned the NTSB to reopen the case in 2013 but was rebuffed. 'The witness statements, the physical evidence and other facts clearly show there was an explosion external to the aircraft, not the center fuel tank,' he told Reuters . As the 18-year anniversary of the incident approaches, the NTSB has said it would not reopen its investigation; the agency is standing by its conclusion that a hot, faulty wire caused a fuel tank to blow up. But now, suddenly, thanks to the slip of the tongue by a leading television news journalist, the conspiracy has been revived. As noted by Jack Cashill, writing at the American Thinker : Some truths CNN reveals only accidentally. One such truth Anderson Cooper shared on the night of July 17. In speaking about the shoot down of Malaysian airliner MH 17 earlier that day, Cooper referred back to 'July 17, 1996, when TWA Flight 800 was shot down off the coast of Long Island in New York.' You can see the video clip here: YouTube.com . Cashill noted that the fate of TWA Flight 800 was 'fresh on Cooper's mind,' as, two days earlier, Cooper hosted a CNN special report on the incident, titled, 'Witnessed: The Crash of TWA Flight 800.' 'Zoom climb' 'To understand the depth of media-government complicity,' Cashill wrote, 'it is useful to compare 'Witnessed' with two prior videos.' One of them is entitled, ironically, 'No Survivors: Why TWA 800 Could Happen Again.' The network created this special report for the 10th anniversary of the crash in 2006. The second video is a 15-minute shoot produced by the CIA in 1997 which Cashill called 'Zoom Climb.' He further wrote: 'Zoom Climb,' the theatrical highlight of the FBI investigation, was designed to negate the stubborn testimony of the eyewitnesses. An animated sequence in 'Zoom Climb' shows an internal fuel tank explosion blowing the nose off the 747. According to the video's narration, TWA 800 then 'pitched up abruptly and climbed several thousand feet from its last recorded altitude of about 13,800 feet to a maximum altitude of about 17,000 feet.' This rocketing aircraft was alleged to look like a missile and to have confused the eyewitnesses. This animation was essential to close the investigation. Without this zoom climb scenario, the FBI had no way to explain what hundreds of official eyewitnesses had actually seen. In the end, Cooper recanted what he had said [see it here: YouTube.com ]. I just want to correct something I said regarding the plane crash, earlier I said that today was the anniversary of flight TWA 800, crashing off the coast of Long Island in 1996. I believe I said that it was shot down. Obviously, the government said it was a center fuel tank explosion. Although some people indicated they saw a rocket, there was no evidence of that. It was ruled to be a center fuel tank explosion, so I apologize for misspeaking about that anniversary.

3," Tweet (NewsTarget) According to new research published in the October issue of the Journal of the American Dietetic Association, patients with high cholesterol who are taking high-dose statin drugs may be able to reduce the effects on their hearts by supplementing their diets with foods rich in plant sterols. High cholesterol -- hypercholesterolaemia -- has strong links to cardiovascular disease, which causes nearly 50 percent of deaths in Europe, and costs the EU roughly $202 billion each year. Previous studies have suggested that patients with high cholesterol can reduce their cholesterol levels by 8 to 17 percent by consuming 1.5 to 3 grams of plant sterols or stanols every day, which translates to a reduction in the risk of heart disease. Researchers from the University Medical Centre Utrecht and the University of Wageningen in the Netherlands studied 20 hypercholesterolaemic patients who were receiving a daily maximum dose of statin drugs -- atorvastatin or simvastatin, 80 mg. The randomized, single-blind study split the participants into two groups: the first received 3 grams of plant stanol-enriched margarine per day (Johnson & Johnson brand Benecol) for six weeks, and the second group received stanol-free margarine each day for six weeks. Both margarines contained the same amount of fat -- 62 percent. At the end of the six-week trial, the group given stanol-enriched margarine experienced a 9.9 percent reduction in plasma cholesterol and a 15.6 percent reduction in LDL cholesterol, while levels of apolipoprotein B (ApoB) -- which is responsible for transporting cholesterol to tissues -- fell by 10.8 percent. Conversely, the control group only experienced a 7.7 percent reduction in LDL cholesterol levels. Total cholesterol remained the same, and ApoB levels fell by 6.8 percent. 'Intensive dietary intervention with addition of plant stanols results in clinically relevant reduction of low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol in patients optimally treated with statins, compared with similar patients on statins receiving only standard care,' the researchers wrote. However, consumer health advocate Mike Adams, author of 'Grocery Warning,' says this research should indicate to patients that plant stanols and sterols can actually replace statin drugs. 'Statin drugs are dangerous chemicals that can produce extremely harmful -- even fatal -- side effects,' Adams said. 'Replacing them with plant-based medicines under the care of a naturopathic physician can greatly improve the health of patients while greatly reducing the cost of their treatment.' ### ",4
3," Americans know that we live in a surveillance society, driven home by the fact that the National Security Agency has been essentially capturing every bit of metadata it can from all of us all of the time. But we knew before that we were being 'watched,' given all of the traffic cams, street cams and satellite surveillance we deal with on a regular basis. What's interesting about this story, however, isn't that retailers are watching us when we shop; it is the manner in which some stores keep an eye on us that is, well, different , as reported by CBS New York : Big Brother could be at your favorite store. As CBS 2's Don Champion reported, a growing number of stores are using discrete and sophisticated technology - including mannequins with facial-recognition cameras hidden in their eyes - to track shopper demographics in an effort to boost sales. Retailers say the marketing data technology allows them to cater their business to customers better, but it's also raising privacy concerns. Ah, yes. Those quaint little 'privacy concerns.' The Fourth Amendment never looked so good, or mattered so little. 'Hey, other systems are more intrusive' This 'unique' surveillance system, called Shopperception, was built by Alfonso Perez and has been utilized by Walmart. According to specs on the system, it links motion-sensors to cameras that then track a shopper's product choice on a particular shelf, as well as the time that it takes for the shopper to make a decision. Perez told CBS New York that his business has doubled in the past year - which means, of course, that your friendly neighborhood big-box retailer cares more about selling you stuff than protecting your constitutional rights. 'We have evolved in the way in which we want our products tailored to our liking,' Perez said. 'The brands and retailers are using this information to learn about us, to learn about what we like,' he added. So, seriously - privacy just doesn't matter anymore? Stores can rip off personal intimate shopping habits at will, even if we don't want anyone else to know what they are? As you might expect, most of the developers of this kind of invasive technology don't think they're doing anything wrong. They don't say their systems are not intrusive - only that they are less intrusive than 'everyday surveillance' such as street and traffic cams. And besides, says Perez, 'We don't store any information on anybody. We process the information real-time.' Tell it to the NSA, Perez. And if you don't store info, how can you match shopping habits to shoppers - in 'real time?' Nevertheless, Perez and others argue that such high-tech systems are vital, because it is becoming more difficult for brick-and-mortar retailers to compete with the online sellers (who also track shopping habits). 'Where do we draw the line?' Joel Reidentberg, a professor of technology at the University of Princeton, said retailers have - understandably - tried to keep mum on the use of the technology. 'If the retailer is unwilling to be transparent with what they're doing, the way they're collecting information, how they're using that information, it says they know their customers will be upset by it,' Reidenberg said, adding: 'We have to decide, do we draw the line?' CBS New York reported that the technology is definitely causing some shoppers to change where they buy. 'Still think it's an invasion of our humanity and who we are as people,' said Bella Milizia. 'It's a little creepy,' another woman told Champion. But as usual, some Americans - constitutional illiterates - don't see anything wrong here. And for the same old reason - lack of guilt. 'You know what, if you're an honest person and you're not up to anything in the store, I think it's fine,' said Janet Sternson.

3," Tweet Losing a modest amount of weight through dietary changes and increased physical activity reduces the occurrence of urinary incontinence (UI) in women with prediabetes, a condition in which blood glucose levels are higher than normal but not yet diabetic. This finding comes from a new study, published in the February issue of Diabetes Care, of women who participated in the Diabetes Prevention Program (DPP), a landmark clinical study funded by the National Institutes of Health (NIH). Launched in 1995, the DPPs main results were announced in 2001 and reported in 2002 (http://www.nih.gov/news/pr/feb2002/hhs-06.htm): losing 5 to 7 percent of weight through diet and a consistent increase in physical activity (e.g., walking 5 days a week 30 minutes a day) reduced the onset of type 2 diabetes by 58 percent. Treatment with metformin lowered the chances of developing diabetes by 31 percent. To combat the dual epidemics of obesity and type 2 diabetes, Americans need to know about the proven benefits of losing some weight through calorie reduction and increased physical activity, said NIH Director Elias A. Zerhouni, M.D. The DPP randomly assigned 3,234 overweight people with higher-than-normal blood glucose levels to one of three approaches to prevent type 2 diabetes: dietary changes and increased physical activity aimed at a 7-percent weight loss; treatment with the oral diabetes drug metformin; or placebo. The last two groups were also given standard medical advice about diet and weight loss. In the study, 660 women were randomly assigned to intensive lifestyle changes, 636 to metformin treatment, and 661 to placebo. Their average age was 50 years old, with an average body mass index of 35 (e.g., a 5 4 woman weighing 204 pounds). Women who implemented intensive lifestyle changes and lost 5 to 7 percent of their weight had fewer episodes of weekly incontinence compared to those in the metformin or placebo groups (38 percent vs. 48 percent vs. 46 percent, respectively.) Our findings reinforce the DPPs good news about the benefits of modest weight loss. A 200-pound woman who loses 10 to 15 pounds not only lowers the risk of developing type 2 diabetes but also improves bladder control, said lead author Jeanette S. Brown, M.D., of the University of California, San Francisco. If youre a woman at risk for type 2 diabetes, preventing or delaying diabetes and improving bladder control are powerful reasons to make these lifestyle changes. Weight loss was particularly effective in reducing episodes of stress incontinence leakage of small amounts of urine during physical movement, such as coughing, sneezing, and exercising. Stress incontinence results, in large part, from a weakening of the pelvic floor muscles that support the bladder. Though researchers do not fully understand all the factors contributing to stress incontinence, it is linked to obesity, diabetes, and other conditions, such as pregnancy, which increase pressure on the pelvic floor. In the DPP participants, weight loss did not alleviate urge incontinence leakage of urine at unexpected times. Urge incontinence is more closely linked to overactive nerves that control the bladder, sometimes triggering inappropriate contractions. More than 13 million people in the United States, mostly middle-aged and older women, experience loss of bladder control. Overweight women and those with type 2 diabetes have a 50- to 70-percent increased risk of incontinence. In the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey 2001-2002 sample, one out of three women with diabetes or prediabetic glucose levels reported weekly or more frequent episodes of UI. Some studies have reported that increased physical activity worsens incontinence, but DPP participants randomly assigned to lifestyle changes, who typically chose walking as their physical activity, did not have increased problems with incontinence. Urinary incontinence is a costly, socially isolating condition that impairs quality of life and takes a psychological toll on many women. For women at risk for type 2 diabetes, losing a modest amount of weight is likely to alleviate incontinence, especially stress incontinence, said Leroy Nyberg, M.D., Ph.D., of the National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases (NIDDK), which funded the study. Nearly 21 million people in the United States 7 percent of the population have diabetes, the most common cause of blindness, kidney failure, and amputations in adults and a major cause of heart disease and stroke. Type 2 diabetes accounts for up to 95 percent of all diabetes cases. The prevalence of type 2 diabetes has risen dramatically in the last 30 years, due mostly to the upsurge in obesity. In addition, about 40 percent of U.S. adults ages 40 to 74 41 million people have prediabetes, which raises the risk of developing type 2 diabetes and cardiovascular disease. The NIDDK funds a great deal of research to improve the treatment and prevention of diabetes and urologic disorders. These efforts include the Urinary Incontinence Treatment Network (http://www.uitn.net/) and the Specialized Center of Research on Lower Urinary Tract Dysfunction in women, a multidisciplinary translational research center at the University of California, San Francisco (http://www.ucsf.edu/scor). Recently, NIDDKs Central Repository (https://www.niddkrepository.org), which houses data collected in large clinical trials funded by the Institute, made data from the DPP available to researchers free of charge. The NIDDK also sponsors 'Let's Talk about Bladder Control for Women,' a campaign to inform women about treatments for incontinence, from pelvic floor exercises to surgery.

3," Tweet (NewsTarget) A study published in the Jan. 17 issue of the Journal of the National Cancer Institute suggests that people can protect themselves from a type of polyp that leads to cancer -- recurrent colorectal adenomas -- for up to five years after discontinuing a daily calcium supplement regiment maintained for four years. A previous study had shown a link between daily calcium supplementation and reduced colorectal adenoma risk, and the recent follow-up study showed that the supplements continue to offer protection after patients discontinue use. Data from 587 patients who previously had at least one colonoscopy was analyzed for seven years after the conclusion of the previous study. At the five-year-mark, the former calcium users showed a 31.5 percent rate of adenoma formation, while the group who never used calcium supplements showed 43.2 percent growth, but no apparent effect on either group was noted after that time. The study also showed that the prior use of calcium supplements reduced advanced adenoma risk, but not in a way that was statistically significant. In an interview with Reuters, study co-author Dr. John A. Baron of Dartmouth Medical School in Lebanon, New Hampshire, said he would like to see future researchers duplicate the results of his study, but noted it was too early to say calcium supplements were a viable way to prevent colorectal cancer. He added that the study turned up evidence that prostate cancer risk might be increased by calcium supplementation. 'I would urge consumers to supplement only with high-grade calcium sources, and avoid products like Tums which actually reduce stomach acid, interfering with the assimilation of minerals like calcium,' said Mike Adams, author of 'The 7 Laws of Nutrition' and a consumer health advocate. Adams said that calcium carbonate is a poor source of calcium, and that calcium citrate is better. The best sources, he said, include things like calcium malate, and he recommended consumers visit WellnessResources.com for 'very high-grade calcium.' 'The best way to take calcium is with acidic natural foods such as citrus or strawberries,' he said. 'A little vinegar, taken with calcium supplements, can also boost absorption and assimilation.' ### ",1
3," Is disgraced NBC News anchor Brian Williams about to drop a dime on others in his industry who might have 'fabricated' stories or otherwise embellished during the recounting of their news coverage? It seems possible in light of a threat issued by the 55-year-old anchor to make his departure from the network 'really ugly,' say reports. Britain's Daily Mail noted that Williams is refusing to go down 'without a fight' as he angles for a return to his nightly news reader desk, a source close to the network told the paper. The threats come on the heels of an internal inquiry report that found that Williams had lied repeatedly - at least 11 times - to make himself appear to be something he is not or was not. Williams was suspended from his anchor chair with no pay for six months in February after it was revealed that he provided false details regarding his presence aboard a U.S. military helicopter during the earliest days of the Iraq invasion. Williams said his chopper was hit by RPG fire over Iraq, which was patently untrue. Does Williams have the goods on other network liars? A source who is allegedly close to NBC News told the New York Post 's 'Page Six' that he 'is saying he's not going down without a fight and [is] threatening to make it really ugly - worse than Ann Curry.' Curry departed the network's Today show in 2013 amid an outpouring of negative publicity. As the Post noted, Curry made a teary-eyed, emotional on-air good-by as her co-host, Matt Lauer, looked on sheepishly. The Post further noted that both Curry and Williams are represented by 'pit bull lawyer' Williams & Connolly's Bob Barnett. 'They want Brian to resign,' said one source. 'If they have to fire him, they can't control him.' The rising tension between Williams and parent company NBCUniversal has become more evident lately. On April 24, NBC released its internal probe, which found the additional instances of Williams' embellishment. Three days later, the Post said, a report that was positive towards Williams just happened to surface stating that NBC News chief Andy Lack was looking for a way to save the disgraced anchor's job. However, days later, anti-Williams factions indicated to The Hollywood Reporter that Lack is not sure he can keep Williams or that the anchor will ever return. In Williams' absence, Lester Holt has been anchoring NBC Nightly News . The Post further reported that there is no question there is increasing urgency within NBCUniversal management ranks to get past the Williams episode, in large part because the nightly newscast's ratings are tanking. 'No one is speaking out in his defense.' ABC World News Tonight , which is hosted by David Muir, announced recently that it led NBC Nightly News in total viewers during the previous four weeks, which was the first time that had happened in years. In addition, ABC also won the key 25-to-54-year-old demographic for three straight weeks; that is the primary demographic sought by advertisers. NBC is ahead for the season so far, but clearly its market share is falling, and that is likely tied to the Williams disaster. The Post further noted: 'As talks between Williams and Comcast's NBCUniversal unit heat up, Williams is believed to be trying to ensure that he is entitled to a payout under the five-year, $10 million-per-year deal he signed last year .' 'They are not going to give him an opportunity to do an Ann Curry,' said a source familiar with news management. In addition, former Meet the Press anchor David Gregory has been kept off the air to prevent him from making any on-air remarks regarding Williams' departure. 'NBC seems intent on damaging him,' said a friend of Williams. 'No one is speaking out in his defense.'

3," Oil pulling, also called oil swishing, is an ancient Ayurvedic folk remedy that involves swishing oil around in your mouth to draw toxins from the body. Though oil pulling is usually recommended for treating mouth-based conditions such as halitosis, gingivitis or oral plaque, it actually benefits the entire body. Long-term oil pulling has, for instance, also been linked to healthier hair, clearer skin, whiter teeth, elimination of parasites, improved body odor and the easing of joint pains. It is, in short, a full-body cleanse, and anyone with $5 to spare on good-quality oil can reap its benefits. It isn't difficult to find instructions on how to pull oil online. However, many of them deviate greatly from the original protocols. What follows below, then, is a more authentic set of instructions for oil pulling that remain faithful to the original protocols yet are adapted for the modern lifestyle. Instructions Before you can start oil pulling, you will need the following items: 1.) Cold-pressed, organic sesame oil. If you cannot purchase (or tolerate) sesame oil, consider sunflower oil instead. These are the two 'warming' oils recommended by the Ayurveda. 2.) A spare toothbrush (separate from the one you normally use to brush your teeth). 3.) Himalayan crystal salt or unrefined sea salt. Once you have these items, you can begin by following these steps: 1.) Upon waking, swish the sesame oil around your mouth for between 15-20 minutes. You should do this before eating or drinking. When swishing, avoid gargling the oil . Instead, favor slow chomping and pulling motions, ensuring that the oil reaches all parts of your mouth. You'll probably find that the oil becomes thinner (and whiter) after the 10-minute mark, as it becomes increasingly loaded with toxins. 2.) After 15-20 minutes of swishing (your mouth might ache from the repetitive motions during the first few sessions), spit the oil into a toilet. For obvious reasons, the toxin-filled oil should never be swallowed. 3.) Mix a teaspoon of Himalayan salt or sea salt into some water and wash the solution around your mouth. This will help kill and flush out remaining toxins. 4.) You now have the choice to either repeat the process again, or end it by brushing your teeth . Repeating the process results in a much more aggressive cleanse (the second pull is often more effective than the first), so it might make you nauseous if you are new to the process. 5.) Clean your teeth gently using the spare toothbrush. You'll want to avoid using your normal toothbrush, because it's unlikely that the salt water will have removed all toxins clinging to the teeth and tongue. This means that the spare toothbrush will accumulate undesirable toxins over time and is unsuitable for casual brushing. 6.) Lastly, brush your teeth a second time using your normal toothbrush and your favorite toothpaste. This helps clean your teeth normally and also freshens your breath. Most people begin to experience whiter teeth and an improved mood within weeks of following this protocol. More significant and noticeable benefits will manifest months later, including a possible end to medical conditions that have plagued you for years. ",4
3," He was widely panned for it, but former Texas Gov. Rick Perry, who recently joined the crowded field of Republican presidential contenders, became the first and so far, only member of that group that has tied the recent Charleston, S.C., shootings to Big Pharma. In an appearance on NewsmaxTV's Steve Malzberg Show , Perry made the claim that the killing of nine African American worshippers by avowed white supremacist Dylann Roof was caused by mind-altering drugs. In response to a question by Malzberg regarding whether he thought the shootings were an act of terrorism, Perry noted, 'I don't know, but I think the facts, once we get them there were more people than that killed in Paris,' he said, a reference to the attacks by Islamic terrorists on the offices of satire magazine Charlie Hebdo . 'This was a crime of hate we know that.' 'The VA is handing out these opioids' Perry continued: 'It seems to me, again without having all the details about this, that these individuals have been medicated and there may be a real issue in this country from the standpoint of these drugs and how they're used.' He went on to point out that mood-and-mind-altering psychotropic drugs have been at the center of virtually all mass shootings in the U.S. since the Columbine school shootings in the late 1990s (see our report on this here ). Perry also noted that 'the Veterans Administration, for instance, is handing out these opioids in massive amounts. And then people question: 'Well, why can't these young individuals get work?' Or, 'Why is the suicide rate so high?'' (We have also covered this issue; see one of our reports here ). During the interview, Perry also lashed out at President Barack Obama for politicizing the killings. 'This is the [modus operandi] of this administration, any time there is an accident like this,' Perry said. 'The president is clear, he doesn't like for Americans to have guns and so he uses every opportunity, this being another one, to basically go parrot that message. 'So, I mean, there are a lot of issues here underlying this that I think we as a country need to have a conversation about,' Perry concluded, 'rather than just the knee-jerk reaction of saying, you know, if we can just take all the guns away this won't happen,' he said. He went on to say as well that he was not advocating any specific policy change in reaction to the shootings, but he was adamant about the drug connection, as others have been. Mass shootings and drugs Perry, we should also note, may be sounding a little duplicitous on this issue. You may recall that, in February 2007 , while still governor of Texas, 'issued an executive order that bypassed the will of the Texas people and the entire legislature, mandating the vaccination of young girls -- in Grade 6 in Texas -- with the HPV vaccine Gardasil,' as Christina Luisa reported in 2011. 'Merck, the pharmaceutical company in charge of the villainous venture and the chief distributor of the vaccine, was the same drug company that was reported to have given thousands of dollars to Perry's campaign efforts,' Luisa wrote at the time for selfnews . Still, the connection between Big Pharma psychotropic medications and mass shootings cannot be denied or ignored. In the case of the Charleston killings, the suspect Dylann Roof was arrested a few months before carrying non-prescribed suboxone, a medication approved by the FDA for the treatment of opioid dependence such as heroin addiction.

3," Sentiment is rising among local sheriffs all across the country to take a stand against what they perceive as a wave of unconstitutional gun control laws coming down the pike, with many pledging to ignore measures that would ban certain firearms or otherwise punish law-abiding gun owners with new, onerous restrictions. In Missouri, Johnson County Sheriff Charles M. Heiss is urging state colleagues, as well as sheriffs from all over the nation, to send a letter to the White House similar to one that he says he sent to the president Jan. 16 . In the letter, Heiss - who said he has held his office since 1997 - expressed concern with the 'tone' of the administration regarding the White House's pledge to use whatever means necessary to impose new gun control measures. 'Sworn duty' to protect the citizens and the Constitution 'It appears to me and many Americans that there is a genuine desire on the part of your administration to restrict the Second Amendment rights of law abiding American citizens in the interest of curbing gun violence in our nation,' Heiss wrote. 'Any attempt to restrict these Second Amendment rights through executive order is unconstitutional and tantamount to an all-out assault on the United States Constitution.' Heiss goes on to tell Obama in the letter that he has a 'sworn duty' to protect his constituents not just from the criminal element, but from any federal efforts to deny them their constitutional rights. Michael Dixon, a newly elected sheriff in Osage County, located in the central part of the state, is one of about a dozen sheriffs in Missouri who have signed Heiss' letter and sent it to Washington, CBS affiliate KMOX reported. 'On the same day the president is taking his oath to uphold the Constitution, he continues to attack our Second Amendment rights,' Dixon said. 'As Osage County Sheriff, I also took an oath to the Constitution , but unlike Obama, I intend to uphold mine.' Dixon also said he supported Missouri House Bill 170, which would criminalize any effort by local, state or federal law enforcement officials who tried to enforce any of the gun control measures currently under consideration by Congress or implemented by Obama as executive orders. 'The president comes from Chicago...' 'President Obama should quit his attempts to take guns out of the hands of law-abiding citizens and instead focus on stopping the criminals that will get them no matter what,' Dixon said. 'It is imperative we strengthen the penalty for criminals who use weapons in the commission of a crime or to cause bodily harm.' He added that his office won't enforce any new gun control proposals that violate the Bill of Rights . He also pointed to previous and existing gun control efforts and crime statistics that demonstrate gun bans don't work. 'The President comes from Chicago, the city with the strictest gun laws and worst gun violence in the country,' said Dixon, according to KMOX . 'It has been proven time and time again that taking guns from law abiding citizens only emboldens thugs, thieves, and rapists, not stop them from committing crimes.' What would your sheriff do? Here are some other local law enforcement officials who have made similar pledges: -- Collin County, Texas, Sheriff Terry Box has declared that neither he nor his deputies would enforce unconstitutional gun laws passed or decreed by those he calls misguided politicians . In a statement laying out his position, Box said: In light of recent events I feel I need to make a public statement of my views on this subject. As the Sheriff of Collin County, Texas, I have for the past 28 years served to protect and keep safe all citizens of our county, recognizing the trust placed in me with this profoundly important responsibility. Unfortunately, the recent surge in the numbers of innocent victims who have died at the hands of unstable criminals has prompted politicians in Washington to seek to pass laws that would seriously erode the constitutional rights of innocent and law abiding citizens. Neither I, nor any of my deputies, will participate in the enforcement of laws that violate our precious constitutional rights, including our Second Amendment right to keep and bear arms. As long as I remain Sheriff of Collin County, I will not participate in the actions of misguided politicians who seek to impede our citizen's right to all of the privileges afforded by our Constitution. -- Jackson County, Kentucky Sheriff Denny Peyman, during a recent town-hall style meeting, declared his unequivocal defense of the Second Amendment and the sheriff's historic role as the dominant law enforcement official in his jurisdiction: You'll understand me very well when you leave here today, and why we're all still going to have our guns here in Jackson. I am responsible for the people inside this county... I couldn't justify, if [President] Obama passes this, it doesn't matter what he passes, the sheriff has more power than the federal people. They need to go back and study that. We are a commonwealth. I can ask federal people to leave, they have to leave. I can ask state people to leave, they have to leave. . Peyman was http://youtu.be . -- Arizona's Pinal County Sheriff Paul Babeu has sent a letter to Obama stating that he will not obey unconstitutional executive orders banning firearms. I have sworn a solemn oath to preserve, protect and defend the Constitution of the United States of America when I was first sworn in as an Army Private, later as an Army Officer, then as a Police Officer and now twice as the constitutionally elected Sheriff. You too, Mr. President, have taken the same oath, therefore I am gravely alarmed - just as most Americans are - that you would attempt to circumvent the Constitution of the United States. What will your local sheriff do? Now is the time to call him and ask.

3," In what is quickly shaping up to be the biggest and most serious Obama White House scandal since the fraudulent birth certificate fiasco , the recent attack on the American diplomatic outpost in Benghazi, Libya, on September 11, 2012, which resulted in four Americans being killed, has caused widespread public outrage at the Obama administration for its apparent willful refusal to protect American life. According to emerging reports, the Obama administration was fully aware of the attack as it was occurring, but deliberately ordered a 'stand down' rather than send help. The mainstream media is all over the map in its coverage of this shocking incident, which many are now referring to as 'Benghazigate,' but the truth of the matter is that there is no way the White House did not know what was occurring at the outpost, regardless of claims to the contrary. Repeated petitions for help from those on the ground in Benghazi went unanswered, which the White House has since tried to cover up with all sorts of excuses. Leaked information reveals not only that the White House knew full well about the attack as it was happening , but deliberately did nothing about it, which some have already dubbed a blatant act of treason by the occupying administration. Then, there is the inconvenient fact that the Obama administration had already been caught involved in a major CIA gun-running operation that included shipping 400 tons of weapons and military gear into and through Libya, which some are now calling 'Fast and Furious II.' There is also speculation among some that Ambassador Stevens, who was killed in the recent attack, had actually been directly involved in this gun running scheme prior to his death, which raises even more questions about what actually took place during the melee. Was General Ham fired from his position at AFRICOM for trying to help protect American life? It has also been revealed that General Carter F. Ham, who had been a top commander for U.S. AFRICOM, was immediately removed from his post after attempting to defy orders from the White House ordering him to stand down and do nothing in response to the attack. This was confirmed on October 18 when Barack Obama made an announcement nominating Gen. David M. Rodriguez to replace the now-fired Gen. Ham, who many familiar with the largely unreported details of the chilling saga are hailing as a hero. There are so many details and criss-crossing paths of information, in fact, that it is difficult to know exactly what took place on that fateful day, and what the motivations were behind the decision to order a stand down . Many important questions remain unanswered, and the mainstream media seems mostly disinterested in getting to the bottom of the issue, instead choosing to accept the official and ever-evolving story about this dastardly scourge in American history. 'The breach on America's diplomatic outpost in Benghazi that left Ambassador Christopher Stevens, two Navy SEALs and an additional civil servant dead, is a foreign policy debacle so colossal, so convoluted, that piecing together its moving parts may be nearly an impossible feat,' wrote Tiffany Gabbay from The Blaze recently about the fiasco.

3," A new report says that the number of illegal aliens currently residing in the United States has surpassed the number of unemployed Americans looking for work, a statistic that is bound to become a factor in the 2016 presidential race. As reported by the Washington Free Beacon , new data from the Pew Research Center found that there were approximately 11.3 million illegal immigrants in the U.S. in 2014, compared to 9.6 million American citizens who were unemployed in the same year. The Pew report, which utilized data from the Labor Department's Bureau of Labor Statistics, notes: An estimated 11.3 million unauthorized immigrants lived in the U.S. in 2014. The new unauthorized immigrant total includes people who cross the border illegally as well as those who arrive with legal visas and remain in the U.S. after their visas expire. Of the 11.3 million illegals, 8.1 million are currently participating in the labor force. 'Unauthorized immigrants make up 5.1 percent of the U.S. labor force,' said the Pew report . 'In the U.S. labor force, there were 8.1 million unauthorized immigrants either working or looking for work in 2012.' Read more about unemployment in America at unemployment.fetch.news Issue will be a priority for many Americans in 2016 By 2014, the report states, 1.7 million more illegal immigrants were living in the country than there were jobless Americans. The BLS data indicate that the average number of unemployed Americans in 2014 was 9.6 million; the agency defines an unemployed person as someone who was without a job but who was actively searching for one in the previous four weeks. The WFB noted that President Barack Obama's executive actions on immigrants, which critics say amounted to an unconstitutional executive amnesty, that he enacted in November of 2014 will ultimately result in more illegal aliens becoming active in the U.S. labor force. 'Last year, President Barack Obama took executive action to expand an existing program and establish a new one that would offer work permits and deportation relief to an estimated 5 million unauthorized immigrants ,' the Pew report stated. 'The actionswhich are on hold because of a lawsuit by 26 stateswould be open to unauthorized immigrants who were brought to the U.S. illegally as children, who are parents with a child who is a U.S. citizen or legal permanent resident, as long as they meet certain requirements.' The Pew report noted that illegal immigration to the U.S. exploded between 1990, when there were about 3.5 million inside the country, and 2007, when the figure grew to more than 12 million. But the employment disparity is certain to garner attention, not only among the American electorate, but also from presidential candidates, some of whom have already made headlines criticizing Obama's immigration policies. 'You can't be talking about anything else' Billionaire real estate mogul and reality TV star Donald Trump was the first to really broach the subject in a manner than rankled the political elite but nevertheless struck a chord with average Americans, judging by his meteoric rise to the top of Republican polls. When he launched his bid in July, Trump emphatically stated that a large number of aliens crossing illegally into the U.S. were criminals specifically 'rapists' and 'murderers' and that Mexico was not sending its best citizens. Less than a week after making his controversial comments, 32-year-old Kate Steinle of San Francisco was killed by a 45-year-old illegal alien from Mexico who had been deported five times and recently released from custody by San Francisco officials. Since then, Trump has elevated the topic of 'sanctuary cities' like San Francisco to the fore, calling such local policies dangerous and caused by an 'unsafe border.' Another top Republican candidate, Wisconsin Gov. Scott Walker, has made standing up for American workers versus those who are in the country illegally part of his campaign. 'You can't be talking about anything else until you do that,' Walker said during a recent appearance on Fox News ' 'Hannity' program.

3," As research continues to confirm the deadly effects of sitting for long periods of time, savvy workers are switching to standing desks and reaping the benefits. Notable advocates of tall work stations include Thomas Jefferson, Charles Dickens, Winston Churchill and Ernest Hemingway, among others. All sensed the inherent reward of increased creativity, alertness and physical stamina. What they may not have known is that standing desks can save lives. Health perils of sitting Linked with an increased likelihood of heart disease, inflammation, obesity, type 2 diabetes and cancer, lengthy periods of sitting are bad news for health. According to the selfnews article, 'More evidence suggest that desk jobs and excessive sitting are deadly,' researchers at Leicester University in the U.K discovered: '... the longer a person sits each day, the more likely he or she is to develop markers of metabolic syndrome, which include high levels of both glucose and fatty acids in the bloodstream. As it turns out, an individual's metabolic rate, which represents the amount of energy expended while at rest, also plummets while sitting, which in the absence of proper exercise can lead to being overweight or obese.' Additionally, the Mayo Clinic states: 'From previous studies we also know that a sedentary lifestyle is associated with increased risk for type 2 diabetes, heart disease and certain cancers (breast and colon).' Thankfully, we need not succumb to such dire consequences of a sedentary life. When we take a stand for health, we can fend off disease while encouraging better focus, productivity, energy and zest. Not to mention a svelte waistline. Stand-up and thrive Instead of slouching over your computer for hours on end, consider a standing desk. Used by great minds throughout history, standing upright while working burns calories, increases blood flow, reduces neck strain and keeps us healthy. Steve Connor notes in The Independent : 'Scientists have found that a person's metabolic rate crashes to a minimum when sitting and that standing up for an extra three hours a day, even without exercising, would on average burn off about 3.6kg of fat a year.' And Chris Adams in 'The Benefits of a Standing Desk,' observes: 'Another benefit of a standing desk is an increase in your focus, alertness and activity level. These all support each other. When standing it is easier to release restless energy. Combine that with the good circulation, stable blood sugar and an active metabolism and it is easier to focus on the task at hand. Many authors and statesmen throughout the centuries who swear by working at a standing desk have claimed that it helps get the creative juices flowing. It also fights fatigue and improves tiredness.' If you are sold on the idea, here are a few tips to keep in mind: - Place the computer screen at eye level to avoid neck strain - Arms should be kept at a 90 degree angle - Stand straight with feet shoulder width apart Also, do not purely stand throughout your work day as this increases the risk of carotid atherosclerosis along with varicose veins. Gentle movements such as shifting weight from one foot to the other as well as an anti-fatigue mat are helpful to keep leg circulation humming. ",1
3," Tweet 412 BC Major epidemic of a disease (which, although not called influenza, probably was influenza) recorded by Hippocrates. 1357 AD The term, influenza, from the Italian word meaning 'influence,' was coined. Popular belief at that time blamed the development of flu on the influence of the stars. 1485 'Sweating sickness,' a flu-like malady, sickens hundreds of thousands of people in Britain. The Lord Mayor of London, his successor and six aldermen die. The Royal Navy cannot leave port due to the sickness of sailors. Doctors prescribe tobacco juice, lime juice, emetics, cathartics and bleeding as treatments for the disease. 1580 First recorded influenza pandemic begins in Europe and spreads to Asia and Africa. 1700s Influenza pandemics in 1729-1730, 1732-1733, 1781-1782. 1781 Major epidemic causing high mortality among the elderly spreads across Russia from Asia. 1830 Major epidemic causing high mortality among the elderly spreads across Russia from Asia. 1831, 1833-1834 Influenza pandemics hit. 1847-1848 Influenza sweeps through the Mediterranean to southern France and then continues across in Western Europe. 1878 A disease causing high mortality in poultry becomes known as the 'fowl plague.' Fowl plague is now called HPAI avian influenza. 1889-1890 The 'Russian flu' spreads through Europe and reaches North America in 1890. 1900 Major epidemic. 1918-1919 The 'Spanish Flu' circles the globe (though some experts think it may have started in the U.S.). Caused by an H1N1 flu virus, it is the worst influenza pandemic (and subsequently, epidemic) to date. There are more than half a million U.S. deaths; worldwide death estimates range from 20 million to 100 million. According to WebMD, 'The pandemic comes before the era of antibiotics -- which are now essential in treating the secondary bacterial infections that often kill flu-weakened patients -- so it's difficult to say whether this flu would have the same dreadful impact in the modern world. But it is a very frightening disease, with very high death rates among young, previously healthy adults.' 1924 The first outbreak of HPAI avian influenza -- bird flu -- in the U.S. It does not spread among humans. Late 1920s Richard Shope shows that swine influenza can be transmitted through filtered mucous, implying that influenza is caused by a virus. 1933 Sir Christopher Andrewes, Wilson Smith and Sir Patrick Laidlaw isolate the first human influenza virus. 1940 Frank Macfarlane Burnet grows influenza on a laboratory growth system (embryonated chicken eggs). 1941 George K. Hirst discovers that influenza causes hemagglutination of red blood cells, thus providing a new method of assaying for the virus 1955 Sir Christopher Andrewes, along with Burnet and Bang, coins the term 'myxovirus' for the influenza family. 1957-1958 The 'Asian Flu' causes the second pandemic of the 20th century. Caused by an H2N2 virus, it begins in China and kills one million people worldwide, including 70,000 Americans. 1968-1969 The 'Hong Kong Flu' causes the last flu pandemic. It was caused by an H3N2 virus and killed some 34,000 Americans. The relatively low death toll is thought to have been due to two factors. First, the virus contained the N2 protein humans had been exposed to before. Second, an H3 virus circulated around the turn of the century, giving some immune protection to elderly people who had caught the flu back then. Mid-1970s Researchers realize that enormous pools of influenza virus continuously circulate in wild birds. 1976 Swine flu breaks out among a handful of soldiers stationed at Fort Dix, N.J. One dies. It's an H1N1 virus, and health officials worry that they are seeing the return of the 1918 H1N1 Spanish Flu pandemic. As the virus is circulating among U.S. pigs, President Gerald Ford calls for a crash vaccination program. Despite delays, a vaccine is made and a quarter of the U.S. population is inoculated. There were 25 deaths from a rare paralytic complication of the vaccination (Guillain-Barre syndrome). Nobody else died of swine flu, which never caused an epidemic. 1977 Mild Russian influenza epidemic occurs. 1983 The second HPAI outbreak occurs in the U.S. Caused by an H5N2 virus, it does not spread among humans. However, this severe poultry epidemic strikes chickens, turkeys and guinea fowl in Pennsylvania and Virginia. It is finally brought under control after the destruction of 17 million birds. 1988 Wiley, Wilson and Skehel determine the location of the antigenic sites on the hemagglutinin molecule by X-ray crystallography. 1996 HPAI H5N1 bird flu is isolated from a farmed goose in Guangdong, China. May 1997 The first person known to catch H5N1 bird flu dies in Hong Kong. The virus has been causing an epidemic among poultry in the city. November-December 1997 There are 18 new human cases of H5N1 bird flu in Hong Kong, 12 with direct contact with infected poultry. Six people die. Officials destroy 1.4 million chickens and ducks. Jan. 5, 2003 Health authorities in Vietnam inform the WHO office in Hanoi of an outbreak of severe respiratory illness in 11 previously healthy children hospitalized in Hanoi, with the most recent hospital admission on Jan. 4. Seven cases were fatal and two patients remain critically ill. A 12th case, a sibling of one of the Hanoi cases, died of a respiratory illness in a provincial hospital. ",4
3," Tweet (NewsTarget) U.S. newspaper publishers are shifting their focus away from print subscribers and toward the Internet as print advertising revenue continues to fall, according to presentations made at the annual Mid-Year Media Review, hosted by the Newspaper Association of America . 'The Internet is no longer an add-on,' said Reid Ashe, chief operating officer of Media General. 'For many applications such as breaking news or increasingly, classified advertising, it's now our primary medium.' Media General owns three metropolitan newspapers -- including the Tampa Tribune and Richmond Times Dispatch -- 22 daily community newspapers, 23 network-affiliated television stations and more than 150 other publications, such as weekly papers. In addition to these media outlets, Media General owns 75 affiliated online enterprises. Media General announced that it expects the profit from its print outlets to be lower in 2007 than 2006; the company's May revenues were 15% lower than its revenues from the same month last year. In contrast, it expects online revenue of $40 million for 2007, and $50 million for 2008. Belo Chairman and CEO Robert W. Decherd announced the Dallas Morning News will reduce its distribution to within 100 miles of Dallas/Fort Worth, in order to save $9 million per year, and that it is planning other circulation cutting measures as well. 'In actively marketing our products, the emphasis should be on attracting quality subscribers rather than seeking quantity at any cost,' Decherd said. 'Instead of focusing on short-term performance, our goal over time is to deliver a stable audience with a demographic profile that is very attractive to advertisers -- and do so in the most cost effective way possible.' However, the Internet may not be as much of a salvation as many have thought. While newspapers' online advertising revenue continues to grow, this growth has slowed -- 20 percent this year, compared to 30 or 35 percent a few years ago. According to the media news site followthemedia.com, this growth is not fast enough to offset declining print revenue. ",4
3," Drinking as little as one can of soda pop per day is enough to increase your risk of both type 2 diabetes and stroke by a significant percentage, according to a new study out of Europe. Based on an analysis involving about 27,000 people who were surveyed on their health and dietary habits, researchers determined that over the course of 16 years, those who drank just one soda a day were 18 percent more likely than others to either develop type 2 diabetes or suffer a stroke. Published in the journal Diabetologia , the study analyzed data on about 12,000 people who developed type 2 diabetes between 1991 and 2007, as well as data on a randomly selected group of roughly 15,000 people without the condition. Researchers then compared data they collected from a survey on soda consumption patterns among all the participants with their respective health outcomes, and adjusted these findings to take into account outside risk factors such as age, physical activity levels, body mass index (BMI) and total daily calorie intake. After refining the data in accordance with generally accepted standards, the research team determined that the risk factors for both type 2 diabetes and stroke jumped by nearly 20 percent over a 16-year period. These findings correspond with a similar study conducted in the U.S. several years ago that linked daily soda consumption with a 25 percent increased risk of type 2 diabetes. 'In European men and women, one 12-ounce daily increment in sugar-sweetened soft drink consumption was associated with a 22 percent increase in hazard ratio [sic] for type 2 diabetes ,' wrote Dr. Dora Romaguera from Imperial College London and her colleagues from the InterAct consortium in their paper. This percentage was adjusted to 18 percent after taking into accounts BMI and caloric intake, according to FoodNavigator.com . '[This study] adds to a growing global literature suggesting that there is a link between consumption of sugar-sweetened beverages, obesity and risk of development of type 2 diabetes,' added Prof. Nick Wareham from the University of Cambridge , who also contributed to the study. 'Together with observations from randomized controlled trials, this observation suggests that consumption of these beverages should be limited as part of an overall healthy diet.' Diet soda consumption also linked to type 2 diabetes So-called 'sugar-sweetened' beverages were not the only processed beverages to be linked to diabetes, however. Based on data from the same survey, participants who drank artificially-sweetened beverages laced with chemicals like aspartame (Sweet'N Low) and sucralose (Splenda) were also found to have an elevated risk of type 2 diabetes compared to participants who drank no soda at all. According to another study published in the journal Diabetes Care , people who drink at least one can of diet soda a day have a 67 percent increased risk of developing type 2 diabetes compared to people who drink no soda at all. 'Zero-calorie' chemical sodas were also linked to significantly increasing the risk factors associated with metabolic syndrome, a classification of risk factors linked to obesity that increase a person's risk of developing not only diabetes and stroke but also heart disease. 'Contrary to conventional thinking, the risk of diabetes is higher with 'light' beverages compared with 'regular' sweetened drinks,' said the National Institute of Health and Medical Research following the release of a French study earlier this year that also linked diet soda consumption to diabetes.

3," Tweet (NewsTarget) Eating a diet low in fat may reduce a woman's risk of breast cancer relapse, according to a study published on December 20 in the 'Journal of the National Cancer Institute.' Researchers studied 2,400 post-menopausal women who had been successfully treated for breast cancer, and monitored their condition for five years. The women had all previously received standard treatments for their cancer, including surgery, hormone therapy, chemotherapy or radiation therapy. One group of women was asked to consume less than 33 grams of fat per day 20 percent of their total calorie intake. The control group ate a standard diet of approximately 51 grams of fat per day, or 30 percent of their total daily calories. After five years, the relapse rate among those who had eaten the low-fat diet was 9.8 percent, compared with 12.4 percent for the control group in other words, a 20 percent lower risk. The difference was statistically significant, said researchers. When the researchers divided the breast-cancer cases depending on whether or not the tumors contained receptors for estrogen hormones, a different pattern emerged. Among those with estrogen-receptor-negative tumors, women who ate the low-fat diet had a 41 percent lower risk of recurrence. Preliminary results suggested that this difference became even more drastic when the observation period was extended past five years. Among those with estrogen-receptor-positive tumors, however, a low-fat diet produced no statistically significant difference in relapse risk. The study could not determine the cause for the correlation between reduced fat intake and reduced risk. Prior studies have shown a correlation between obesity and breast cancer risk, such that gaining 22 pounds can increase person's risk of contracting breast cancer by 18 percent. The recurrence study called the Women's Intervention Nutrition Study was funded by the American Institute of Cancer Research. ### ",4
3," Slowly but surely, traditional American culture and values are being swept away by liberal, progressive activists and culture warriors who actively encourage a break from our past, even if they don't say so directly. The latest example of this dramatic cultural shift comes from coffee icon Starbucks, whose CEO and founder recently told customers and shareholders who happen to believe in the historical nature of marriage as a construct between one man and one woman to stay out of his stores. At the company's annual meeting in Seattle recently, CEO/founder Howard Schultz was challenged by a shareholder who questioned his well-publicized position of supporting gay marriage and last year's support of a referendum in Washington state backing same-sex marriages. Schultz's position led to calls to boycott Starbucks from the National Organization for Marriage, and the shareholder explained that led to lower-than-expected earnings. No tolerance for traditional points of view 'In the first full quarter after this boycott was announced, our sales and our earnings, shall we say politely, were a bit disappointing,' said the shareholder, Tom Strobhar, whom the Huffington Post identified as the founder of the anti-gay marriage group Corporate Morality Action Center. The criticism did not seem to affect Schultz. 'Not every decision is an economic decision. Despite the fact that you recite statistics that are narrow in time, we did provide a 38 percent shareholder return over the last year,' he said, according to a video of his response posted here . 'I don't know how many things you invest in, but I would suspect not many things, companies, products, investments have returned 38 percent over the last 12 months,' he continued. 'Having said that, it is not an economic decision to me. The lens in which we are making that decision is through the lens of our people . We employ over 200,000 people in this company, and we want to embrace diversity. Of all kinds.' The gathered shareholders responded with uproarious applause. Schultz concluded: 'If you feel, respectfully, that you can get a higher return than the 38 percent you got last year, it's a free country. You can sell your shares in Starbucks and buy shares in another company. Thank you very much.' While national attitudes toward same-sex marriage have turned around over the past decade according to a recent ABC News/Washington Post survey , people who still support the traditional definition of marriage (even if they support a same-sex legal 'union') are openly mocked, ridiculed and labeled as 'bigots' and 'homophobes.' Not a free country for all While many Americans mouth platitudes about supporting First Amendment 'religious freedom,' anyone who voices an opinion that doesn't comport with the liberal point of view on this issue is chastised. If traditional marriage supporters are business owners, they are targeted for boycotts, picketed, and even sued in court. The end result is that the business is put out of business, and peoples' livelihoods are taken away from them. If the traditional marriage supporter is a politician or public figure, he or she will be shamed by the mainstream media, shouted down by gay rights activists (who are given platform after platform to do so by the mainstream media) and forced to apologize. The lone exception in the current 2016 presidential race is billionaire real estate mogul Donald Trump, although he has not made any claims to only support traditional marriage. It's the worst kind of thought control, and it's about as anti-Constitution as it gets. After all, the nation's founding document is supposed to protect the rights of everyone to say and think what they wish as long as such speech is not otherwise deemed illegal (for example, slander). Even if we don't agree with what that person is saying. Apparently the Starbucks CEO stands with those who would usurp such speech because it's not what they personally believe. During his rant against the concerns of the traditional marriage shareholder, Schultz said, 'It's a free country.' However, his intolerance belies that; in a truly free country where all points of view are equally respected, he would not have felt the need to belittle anyone.

3," Tweet (NewsTarget) A recent multimillion-dollar ad campaign that lends support to Republican lawmakers who support the new Medicare prescription drug benefit was partly paid for by the pharmaceutical industry, political officials say. Though the U.S. Chamber of Commerce says it paid for the ads -- which are airing in 10 states -- a spokesman has refused to disclose whether or not the Chamber received funds from the Pharmaceutical Research and Manufacturers of America (PhRMA), an organization representing the pharmaceutical industry. The commercials, designed in support of local congressmen and senators, say the Medicare drug program has saved hundreds of thousands of Medicare recipient's money since its inception. Democrats have used the disclosure to charge that the Medicare prescription drug benefit amounts to a plan engineered by Republicans to make more money for drug firms. 'There's a civics lesson here from the drug companies,' says Bill Burton, spokesman for the House Democratic campaign organization. 'They write checks to protect their GOP friends, and then they write the laws to benefit themselves -- all the while doctors are writing prescriptions middle-class Americans can't afford.' Ken Johnson, senior vice president of PhRMA, issued a statement that failed to elaborate on the issue: '[PhRMA] works with a variety of groups, including patient advocacy groups and business organizations like the U.S. Chamber of Commerce and others, to support policies that improve access to life-saving medicines.' 'The depth of collusion among lawmakers, drug companies and government organizations is nothing less than astonishing,' said Mike Adams, a critic of the pharmaceutical industry and author of Take Back Your Health Power. 'That they would all conspire to create false advertising that misleads the American people into thinking they're getting a good deal on overpriced drugs is not at all surprising,' he added. 'Today's pharmaceutical industry is based almost entirely on propaganda, fraudulent science, corruption of government officials, disease mongering and the art of distorting public perception in order to maximize corporate profits.' ### ",4

3," Yes, women are complicated. That much is obvious. By both natural design and the acknowledgement of even prehistoric, mythological culture, the life-bearing ways of the female human creature are both intricate and mysterious. But did you ever wonder why it seems women are always more susceptible to biological vulnerability? The reasons are multi-fold. With so many biological conditions necessary for the effective functioning of the female reproductive system - from menstruation and fertility, to conception and child-bearing - women can be particularly sensitive to both internal and external stimuli. And current culture certainly offers plenty of health challenges from which to choose. If a woman has a poor diet, inactive lifestyle, a stressful career and is not well rested, for example, she may not only feel tense and physically congested, but also find she is at greater risk for complication. This is because these behaviors affect the metabolic rate and hormonal imbalance of the body, resulting in breast tenderness, skin blemishes, food cravings, lowered immune function, decreased resistance to pathogens and infectious germs, and any number of gynecological disorders. To combat these unwanted developments, it is important for women to understand their bodies first from a holistic perspective, to acknowledge, regardless of the symptom that arises, that such symptoms are merely superficial indicators of a much deeper imbalance - one that requires meaningful lifestyle shifts related to diet, activity, etc. From there, to compliment the beneficial behaviors already in place, a woman may desire to seek additional therapeutic support from various herbal remedies, applicable toward everything from regulating and balancing hormones to relieving tension and pain. Dong quai Most popular for its success in relieving menstrual complaints and menopausal symptoms, this pungently sweet Chinese herb is also commonly applied in cases of premenstrual syndrome (PMS), and is useful in addressing irregular cycles and cramping. Naturally high in vitamin B-12, Dong quai contains ferulic acid, a muscle relaxer and pain reliever, as well as blood-thinning chemicals known as coumarins, which work to improve circulation and ensure blood flow to female reproductive organs. Dong quai should be avoided by pregnant women and those suffering from either diarrhea or endometriosis. Blue cohosh This Native American medicine works primarily to help tone and strengthen the uterus. It contains an alkaloid called methyl cytosine, which is believed to be antispasmodic. It also combats painful menstrual flow irregularities by dilating blood vessels in the uterus, allowing for increased circulation in the pelvic area. Women who are pregnant; however, should take care to avoid all products containing blue cohosh . Large doses of the herb were once used by Native American tribes to prevent conception, though modern herbalists now consider it unreliable for that purpose. Cinnamon bark Look for medicinal quality cinnamon, known as Rou Gui , in either Chinese herbal pharmacies or health foods stores. Its pungent sweetness makes it the ideal warming ('yang') tonic for relieving menstrual cramps. Women who find they are chronically cold ('yin'), dry or frail and who may routinely be afflicted with osteoarthritis, asthma or digestive problems will enjoy the greatest benefits from this herbal remedy. Though its side effects are few, be sure to use cinnamon with caution during pregnancy . Chaste tree berries Reportedly used by monks back in the Middle Ages to help curb their sexual appetite, this herbal remedy may occasionally reduce sex drive in women, but not to the extent suggested by its clever name. These days, it plays a significant role in hormone regulation, acting directly on the brain's pituitary gland. Flavonoids present in chaste tree are known to slightly increase women's progesterone production, a lack of which is often the cause of menstrual complaints, infertility, heavy bleeding, excessive periods, irregular periods, no periods and PMS. Chaste tree is a bitter-tasting, slow-acting herb, but over several months, can prove helpful with all these conditions as well as premenstrual fluid retention and even acne. Due to its direct involvement in these hormonal processes, chaste tree is not recommended for use by pregnant women . ",1
3," It doesn't matter whether you are an opponent of Obamacare, as most Americans are, according to numerous surveys since the law's passage by Congress and subsequent rewrite and legitimization by the U.S. Supreme Court. You're going to pay for it anyway, and dearly, according to a new bombshell report from the Congressional Budget Office. As reported by Britain's Daily Mail newspaper in online editions, the cost to the federal government, or, more accurately, the taxpayers who fund it, for every new person insured under the law will be in the neighborhood of $50,000. The paper said budget figures like that one were buried within a 15-page section in the nonpartisan CBO's latest 10-year budget outlook. The Mail further reported: The best-case scenario described by the CBO would result in 'between 24 million and 27 million' fewer Americans being uninsured in 2025, compared to the year before the Affordable Care Act took effect. Pulling that off will cost Uncle Sam about $1.35 trillion -- or $50,000 per head. So much for Obama's ' cost estimates' Needless to say, the new CBO cost figures are nothing like those promised by President Obama and Democrats when they were pushing the measure as a bill in 2009 and 2010. The figures are astounding: It will take $1.993 trillion to hand out insurance subsidies to poor and middle class Americans, as well as to finance a huge expansion of Medicaid and CHIP, or Children's Health Insurance Program, costs. It is, without question, the largest wealth redistribution effort in a generation. To 'offset' those costs, the government will take in only $643 billion in new taxes, fees and penalties related to the Affordable Care Act. Part of that revenue will include the first-ever set of escalating financial penalties -- or, as the Supreme Court defined them, taxes -- on Americans who don't buy a product, in this case health insurance . The revenue also includes a new tax on medical devices, which is actually opposed by both Republicans and some Democrats in Congress (meaning, if this provision is finally repealed, then costs per newly insured person will be even higher). In an address to a joint session of Congress in 2009, Obama promised that his signature legislation would not cost this much. In fact, he said, 'the plan I'm proposing will cost around $900 billion over 10 years' (which is still more than the government is raising to 'pay' for it, but that's a separate issue). 'It would be a significant discount if the White House could return to that number today,' the Mail reported. In the same 2009 speech, Obama made the claim that there were 'more than 30 million American citizens who cannot get [health insurance] coverage.' Using Obama's cost figure of $900 billion, and 30 million who needed coverage, the price tag would still have been hefty -- $30,000 per head -- but not as hefty. That would be only about two-thirds of what the CBO now says the program will cost per insured. The nonpartisan congressional agency, along with the Joint Committee on Taxation -- a group of lawmakers from both chambers of Congress -- prepared the report, which was released Jan. 26, showing the overall direction of the federal budget. The report estimates that 'the net costs of the coverage provisions of the ACA will rise sharply as the effects of the act phase in from 2015 through 2017,' a period when Obama will be preparing to leave office. Millions will still be uninsured Further, costs will 'rise steadily through 2022' before leveling off for three years, economists for the two groups estimated. But, even then, the Obamacare program is expected to add an additional $145 billion in costs each year to a federal budget that is constantly in the red, adding to a federal debt that now has surpassed $18 trillion, or more than a year's worth of U.S. GDP. As the Mail further noted: That number doesn't include the insurance premiums and out-of-pocket health care costs paid by Americans -- only the government's role in implementing the law and paying for its guarantees. The final insult is that, according to the CBO, there will still be 'between 29 million and 31 million' non-elderly Americans without medical insurance -- meaning this entire mammoth law was literally passed for nothing (except, perhaps, to give more centralized control over Americans' lives to Washington).

3," Increasingly, Chinese herbal medicine (CHM) is being put to the test by Western scientists -- and the results are sometimes not only successful but downright astounding. A case in point: a new review of CHM research by British scientists just published in Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews shows treating endometriosis with Chinese herbs may not only relieve symptoms of the disease, CHM appears to have comparable benefits to drugs and even laparoscopic surgery with fewer adverse effects. This is important news because endometriosis is a huge problem in the US and Western medicine has yet to come up with any viable treatment that doesn't have serious side effects. According to the National Institutes of Health (NIH), at least 5.5 million women in North America alone have the disorder and 30 to 40 percent of them are infertile. A condition that causes tissue that normally lines the uterus to grow on the ovaries, bowels, and bladder, behind the uterus or elsewhere, endometriosis often produces debilitating pain that can keep a woman from going to work or school and put enormous strains on relationships. Endometriosis commonly causes severe cramps during menstrual periods, excessive bleeding during periods, chronic pelvic discomfort that can spread to the lower back and pain during or after sex. The cause of endometriosis remains unknown so doctors tend to treat it with prescription pain medications, hormones that can have devastating masculizing effects and even surgery to remove the endometrial growths. In some cases, doctors remove a woman's reproductive organs to try to reduce pain. As the Cochrane review points out, however, surgery doesn't always lead to long-term improvement in symptoms and drug treatments can cause a host of new problems such as hot flushes, acne and weight gain. The new study is the first English language systematic review of CHM for the treatment of endometriosis . The researchers analyzed, in particular, two trials of 158 women. In one clinical trial, therapy with Chinese herbs provided a reduction of symptoms that was comparable to the relief provided by the hormone medication gestrinone . However, the herbs, unlike the drug, caused few side effects. In the second trial, CHM was even more successful in treating endometriosis than the hormonal drug danazol . Once again, the Chinese herbs produced far fewer side effects than the Western medication. 'These findings suggest that Chinese herbs may be just as effective as certain conventional drug treatments for women suffering from endometriosis, but at present we don't have enough evidence to generalize the results,' said lead researcher Andrew Flower of the Complementary Medicine Research Unit at the University of Southampton in the United Kingdom in a statement to the media. A growing number of scientists are actively studying the efficacy of CHM for other conditions, as well. For example, as reported previously in selfnews, researchers have found Chinese herbs can relieve menstrual cramps better than drugs ( http://www.selfnews.com/022969_menstrual_... ) and CHM may also be a successful treatment for type 2 diabetes ( http://www.selfnews.com/024051_diabetes_b... ). Earlier this year, scientists reported in the Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology that Chinese herbs appear to help asthma patients, too.

3," Tweet (NewsTarget) No benefit exists in using the highly toxic drugs for eczema pushed by conventional medicine. Homeopathy has better results without the use of harmful products. A peer-reviewed journal reports that there is no reason to subject your children to life-threatening steroids for eczema. The report, published in Complementary Therapies in Medicine , documents a one-year study of one to sixteen year-old children with eczema. The children treated with homeopathy had equal or better results than those treated with corticosteroids. More intriguing is that those children whose conditions were worse at the beginning of the study had greater degrees of improvement with the homeopathic treatment. This is clearly a win-win for patients. Why would anyone choose potent drugs that can permanently damage health when there's another, safe option? When you add in the fact that homeopathically-treated children may fare better than those treated by conventional medicine, then it's inconceivable why any parent would consider putting a child at risk by treating eczema conventionally, when homeopathy is a safe option. Trial Methodology and Results The study, done in Germany, included both urban and rural subjects recruited between January 1998 and December 2000. Its focus was on patients' and doctors' perceptions of improvement, both in terms of the eczema itself and quality of life. The methodology was designed to reflect routine treatment. Questionnaires were filled out by both physicians and patients, or when necessary, by their parents at the beginning of the study, at six months, and again at 12 months. The study focused on subjective results, not clinical tests. As the authors noted, although clinical tests may show differences in children with eczema and asthma in a biomarker like immunoglobulin E, it doesn't have any bearing on the patient's well-being. Children included had to meet the following criteria: ",4
3," Tweet Low-level exposure to a banned but lingering pesticide appears to accelerate changes in the brain that can potentially lead to the onset of Parkinson's disease symptoms years or even decades before they might naturally develop. This finding, by researchers at Emory University and the Georgia Institute of Technology in Atlanta, was presented today at the 232nd national meeting of the American Chemical Society, the world's largest scientific society. The concept of an accelerated disease process is a new twist in the investigation of the long-suspected link between the use of pesticides and Parkinson's disease, according to the researchers. 'Our current study clearly shows that pesticides such as dieldrin appear to accelerate or exacerbate the already underlying disease,' said Gary Miller, Ph.D., an associate professor of environmental and occupational health at Emory University. 'Pesticides aren't necessarily the causative agents, but they do promote Parkinson's. So it appears the more you are exposed to pesticides, the greater your risk of developing the disease earlier in life.' In their pilot study, Miller and his co-researchers -- Emory graduate student Jaime Hatcher and Georgia Tech Professor Kurt Pennell, Ph.D. -- found that levels of dieldrin, an organochlorine pesticide developed in the 1940s as an alternative to DDT, were three times higher in the brains of 14 people who had Parkinson's disease than in the brains of 12 people who didn't. Based on this finding, the researchers estimated the lifetime exposure levels of these people and extrapolated these levels to mice. They then exposed laboratory mice to low, but 'environmentally relevant' dosages of dieldrin - about 1 to 3 milligrams per kilogram. After one month, although none of the mice showed symptoms of Parkinson's disease, the researchers did detect increased levels of oxidative stress in the brain and significantly reduced uptake of dopamine, the neurotransmitter that plays a key role in the development of Parkinson's. This latest work adds more evidence establishing a link between pesticides and Parkinson's. Earlier this year, a Harvard School of Public Health study of more than 140,000 adults found that those exposed to long-term, low levels of pesticides had a 70 percent higher incidence of Parkinson's disease. Another recent study, by the same Emory/Georgia Tech team, found that fetal rodents exposed to dieldrin had brain alterations that made them more susceptible to Parkinson's-inducing toxins. 'All of the evidence that has been accumulating suggests that exposure to pesticides increases the risk of Parkinson's disease,' Miller said. 'We believe that a person who is destined to get Parkinson's because of genetics or other factors at age 80 might develop symptoms when they're 65 or 70 if they have been exposed to pesticides.' Dieldrin, which was most commonly used to control agricultural pests and termites, was banned for most uses by the Environmental Protection Agency in 1974 after it was found to be harmful to fish and other wildlife. It was totally banned in 1987. Although no longer used, dieldrin can persist in the environment for decades and move up through the food chain, particularly in dairy products and meats, to humans, Pennell said. Over the next few decades, however, dieldrin and other banned pesticides should dissipate in the environment and become less of a factor in the development of Parkinson's disease, according to Miller. 'Today, people are being exposed to much lower levels of pesticides than people were 30 or 40 years ago,' Miller said. 'I would predict that over the course of the next several decades that we will see a decrease in the incidence of Parkinson's disease.' At least 500,000 Americans have Parkinson's disease and about 50,000 new cases are diagnosed each year, according to the National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke. The disease occurs when certain nerve cells die or become impaired and can no longer produce dopamine.

3," A St. Louis weight loss instructor is suing Cola-Cola over their 'My Coke Rewards' program. Julia Harvey says the program could persuade children to drink hazardous quantities of the product. The program rewards Coca-Cola consumers with points for each product they buy, which can be redeemed for prizes such as free vacations. The problem, Harvey says, is that the contest ends in January, and a Coke drinker would have to consume more than 100 cans a day to obtain enough points for some of the prizes. Harvey's lawyer, Albert Watkins, says, 'You will die before you can consume all those products.' The suit was brought against the famous beverage brand out of a sense of moral obligation, according to Harvey, who is not seeking monetary compensation. Instead she wants a permanent injunction to force the company to drop the campaign. She said she would also drop the suit if Coca-Cola altered or dropped their promotion voluntarily, restricted it to adults, or changed the advertising to highlight the fact that consumers do not have to drink the beverage to get points. Scott Williamson, spokesman for Coca-Cola, called the lawsuit 'frivolous and ridiculous.' He says that customers also can obtain points a number of other ways, including sharing cases of Coca-Cola with friends or winning up to 50,000 points from online contests. He added that most of the prizes require fewer than 100 points and 99 percent require fewer than 5,000. According to Williamson, the company has no plans to alter its 'My Coke Rewards' promotion. Coca-Cola is the same company that once launched a, 'Just say no to H2O' campaign to discourage restaurant customers from drinking water. The program has since been abandoned as Coke rolled out its own water beverage product (Dasani). ### ",4
3," Tweet (NewsTarget) Diets that have plenty of olive oil may be helping prevent body cell damage that can lead to cancer, suggests a study by researchers in Denmark. Researchers from Copenhagen University Hospital looked at 182 men between the ages of 20 and 60, hailing from five European countries, for two weeks. During that time, the men consumed one-quarter cup of olive oil a day, and showed an average 13 percent reduction in 8oxodG, a marker of oxidative damage to DNA cells. This damage is usually caused when reactive oxygen species -- metabolism byproducts -- overcome the body's antioxidant defenses. While olive oil is known to contain phenols, which are believed to be powerful antioxidants, they do not account for the drop in oxidative damage to DNA, said study co-author Dr. Henrick E. Poulsen and colleagues. The men consumed olive oils with varying levels of phenols, but the oxidative damage was reduced regardless of these levels. The study results -- reported in the Federation of American Societies for Experimental Biology's The FASEB Journal -- seem to suggest that the monosaturated fats found in olive oil are more likely causing the beneficial effect, the scientists said. The study participants from Northern Europe showed higher 8oxodG levels than their Southern European counterparts, which could account for the fact that, in the past, men from Northern Europe have been found to have higher rates of cancer than men in Southern Europe, where the olive-oil-rich 'Mediterranean diet' is a staple. In fact, the scientists reported, Northern Europeans generally have higher levels certain cancers, including breast, colon, ovarian and prostate cancers. Poulsen said the evidence supports advice that suggests replacing saturated fats from meats and butter with vegetable fats such as olive oil. However, he was quick to point out that olive oil was just one part of the Mediterranean diet, which is also rich in fruits, vegetables, whole grains and fish. He added that olive oil's benefits notwithstanding, it was not a replacement for calorie control and regular exercise. ### ",4
3," As more and more countries within the European Union struggle economically, the euro - the union's common currency - becomes more embattled, with its founder now even predicting its demise. German Finance Minister Oskar Lafontaine, who was responsible the euro's development and launch, is now calling for the end of the single currency in order to let southern Europe recover. He says if not, the current fiscal course is 'leading to disaster.' 'The economic situation is worsening from month to month, and unemployment has reached a level that puts democratic structures ever more in doubt,' he said, according to the Telegraph , one of Britain's largest dailies. 'The Germans have not yet realized that southern Europe, including France, will be forced by their current misery to fight back against German hegemony sooner or later,' he said, adding that much of the current fiscal crisis has come in large part from Germany's squeeze on wages, in order to gain export share. 'Austerity is finished' On the parliamentary website of Germany's Left Party, Lafontaine said German Chancellor Angela Merkel will 'awake from her self-righteous slumber' once the European countries in economic dire straits come together to force changes in crisis policy, at the expense of Germany. Lafontaine's dire prediction appeared to gain credibility as French Finance Minister Pierre Moscovici 'proclaimed the end of austerity and a triumph of French policy, risking further damage to the tattered relations between Paris and Berlin,' the paper reported. 'Austerity is finished. This is a decisive turn in the history of the EU project since the euro,' Moscovici told French TV. 'We're seeing the end of austerity dogma. It's a victory of the French point of view.' The French minister's comments came on the heels of a deal with Brussels giving France and Spain an additional two years to meet deficit targets of 3 percent of GDP. But his triumphant tone could mean that hardliners in Berlin will become angry, confirming fears that such concessions will only lead to more fiscal chaos in the months ahead. In early May German Vice-Chancellor Philipp Rosler attacked the European Commission, calling its decision to undermine the necessary belt-tightening 'irresponsible.' Whether the current breakdown of the German-Franco alliance that has driven politics on the continent for more than a half-century is the fault of Berlin or Paris may be irrelevant at this point, but clearly the situation is spiraling out of control. France's Socialist Party - which now controls the prime minister's office - lashed out at the 'selfish intransigence' of Merkel, accusing her of thinking over of 'German savers, her trade balance, and her electoral future.' For his part, Lafontaine said he backs EMU but just doesn't think it is sustainable. 'Hopes that the creation of the euro would force rational economic behavior on all sides were in vain,' he said, noting that the policy of forcing Spain, Portugal, and Greece to carry out internal devaluations was a 'catastrophe.' The economies of those three nations, plus Ireland and Holland, are among the EU's worst. The euro has been in decline for months now, and as nations of the EU continue to deal with high unemployment and high government spending due to overpromising of benefits and lower revenues, there doesn't seem to be a future for the currency , much less the EU as a viable entity, experts believe. In March, the Atlantic Monthly also reported that it is just a matter of time before the demise of the euro, simply because the EU doesn't have the fiscal infrastructure - or never had it - to make a common currency work: Here's the Cliff Notes version of the euro crisis. The euro zone doesn't have the fiscal or banking unions it needs to make monetary union work, and it's not close to changing that. In the meantime, the euro's continuing flaws continue to suck countries into crisis. And their politics get radicalized. Most recently, Cyprus was forced to accept a bailout and bail-in, because its too-big-to-save banks made some horrendously bad bets on Greek bonds. Fundamental flaws in the euro's design Here are some of the euro's basic flaws: Money is too tight. The euro zone is not what economists would label an optimal place for currency. 'In other words,' Atlantic Monthly says, 'it was a bad idea.' Part of the reason why is because the various EU members should have different monetary policies but they don't. Budgets are too tight. Experts believe austerity has been an utter failure, if not outright disaster, because it has actually increased debt burdens across southern Europe especially. 'The euro has become an austerity suicide pact.' Not enough trade. Save Germany, a little more than half of the EU's nations primarily trade with each other. As southern Europe slides into depression and northern Europe edges toward recession, each will purchase even less from the others. As with all socialist countries, the nations of Europe simply do not have enough resources to continue providing cradle-to-grave services for their people. That is angering to tens of millions who have been raised to believe that the European money pit is bottomless but who are now realizing the fallacy of such thinking. As an aside, it is important to note that both world wars last century began on a tumultuous European continent . ",4
3," Do American liberals and conservatives look at political, social and ethical issues as if they are from different cultures? Yes, according to a new landmark study that examined the differences. The cultural psychology study, conducted by the University of Virginia, found that, essentially, political conservatives in the U.S. are somewhat like East Asians in the manner in which they categorize, think and perceive. Meanwhile, 'liberals in the U.S. could be categorized as extreme Americans in thought, categorization and perception,' said a press release describing the study's findings, which have been published recently in the Personality and Social Psychology Bulletin . In addition, researchers found evidence that styles of thought -- whether holistic or analytical -- can be altered through training, and enough so that temporary changes in political thought and the way a person votes could occur. 'We found in our study that liberals and conservatives think as if they were from completely different cultures -- almost as different as East and West,' said study leader Thomas Talhelm, a Ph.D. candidate in cultural psychology. Conservative thinking dominates the world 'Liberals and conservatives categorize and perceive things differently, just as East Asians and Westerners look differently at the world,' he continued. Talhelm said that, according to study findings, American conservatives, generally speaking, and East Asians in particular, are intuitive, or 'holistic,' thinkers, though Westerners, generally, and American liberals in particular, think in a more analytical manner. That said, the term culture war is thought to be an accurate, though dramatic, description of the clear cultural differences in thought processes between conservatives and liberals 'On psychological tests, Westerners tend to view scenes, explain behavior and categorize objects analytically,' Talhelm said, according to the press release. 'But the vast majority of people around the world -- about 85 percent -- more often think intuitively -- what psychologists call holistic thought, and we found that's how conservative Americans tend to think.' The Ph.D candidate said holistic thought uses intention and the perception of whole objects or situations most often, instead of dissecting them into their individual parts -- like having a general feeling about a given situation involving intuition or tact. Meanwhile, he added, the study results indicated that analytical thinkers tend to examine parts of a situation and how they may work in tandem, toward the whole. This process involves 'slicing up the world and analyzing objects individually, divorced from context,' Talhelm said. The press release further stated: Studies show that analytical thinkers predominate in Western, educated, industrialized, rich and democratic societies (termed 'WEIRD' societies in 2010 by a team of cultural psychologists at the University of British Columbia). But they make up only about 15 percent of the world's population. So, in other words, in a WEIRD society like that found in the United States, analytical-thinking liberals are considered 'extreme Americans,' said Talhelm, in the manner that they are disinclined to think like the vast majority of the rest of the world, and that includes holistically thinking conservatives in their own country. Liberal thinking must be learned But, the researcher noted, there is some value in both ways of thinking. Intuitive thinking, Talhelm said, is likely the 'default' style that most people are born with. Analytical thinking, he continued, must necessarily be learned through training -- as in Western-style school systems (Writer's note: The term indoctrination comes immediately to mind). In testing thought styles, psychologists give study participants a short series of tests to determine what manner of thinker they happen to be -- holistic or analytic. 'One such test asks participants to choose two of three items to categorize together, such as a mitten, a scarf, and a hand,' said the press release. 'Analytic thinkers usually match the scarf and mitten because they belong to the same abstract category -- items of winter clothing. Holistic thinkers usually match the mitten and hand because the hand wears a mitten.' Researchers found, however, that political thought could be manipulated. Holistic thinkers could be trained to think analytically, for instance, to match scarf with mitten; in doing so, they would begin to view the world more liberally (except on economic policy). Likewise, in reverse, for liberal thinkers. Sources: http://psp.sagepub.com http://www.designntrend.com https://news.virginia.edu ",1
3," Not only can dogs sense the earth's magnetic field, but they can actually use it to orient their bodies when they relieve themselves, according to a study conducted by researchers from the Czech University of Life Sciences and the University of Duisburg-Essen in Germany, and published in Frontiers in Zoology . Magnetoreception, or the ability to sense the earth's magnetic field, has been demonstrated in a wide variety of animals, including bees, birds and even some mammals. 'We discovered [by measuring Google Earth aerial pictures] that cattle align with the magnetic field lines a few years ago,' researcher Sabine Begall said. 'Since then, we studied hunting behavior in [the] red fox and found that they have a preference for N-E during their mousing jumps, and from there it was just a small step to study dogs. First, we looked also at other behaviors but the results were less promising than the 'pooping direction.'' The current study is the first to demonstrate magnetoreception in dogs. 'Precisely oriented... while pooping' The researchers observed 70 different dogs of 37 different breeds over the course of two years, measuring how the dogs oriented themselves during a total of 1,893 defecations and 5,582 urinations. In order to control for any influence that humans might have on the dogs' behavior, all humans in the dogs' presence were kept 'blind' to magnetic orientation. The researchers found that unleashed dogs naturally oriented themselves toward magnetic north or south while defecating or urinating and completely avoided facing east or west. This orientation pattern remained consistent regardless of dog breed, sex, time of day, time of year or prevailing weather conditions. Although the researchers ruled out the possibility that the dogs were merely orienting themselves relative to the sun, they found that the sun did play an unexpected role in the dogs' behavior: solar flares and geomagnetic storms produced temporary disruptions in the earth's magnetic field , causing the dogs to revert to facing in random directions while relieving themselves. 'The dogs are very precisely oriented on the north-south axis while pooping, but only if the magnetic field is stable,' researcher Petra Kovakova said. 'On January 6 the magnetic field was very stable, which means that the dogs were very well oriented during pooping,' Kovakova said. 'On January 2 the magnetic field was very restless and the dogs were pooping in a random fashion.' In fact, natural fluctuations in the Earth's magnetic field initially made it difficult for the researchers to discern the underlying pattern in the dogs' behavior. 'We were quite frustrated, because we couldn't find a clear preference for a certain direction,' Begall said. 'Then, we sorted the data according to the prevailing [magnetic-field] conditions at the time of recording, and this analysis revealed a highly significant and predictable effect.' 'It could be that the dogs somehow calibrate their compass or read their 'mental map' during the walks,' she said. 'Imagine that you read a compass during a hike. If the compass needle is shaky, you might dismiss reading the compass at all. That could be the reason why the dogs have no preference when the [magnetic field] is unstable.' The researchers have no idea why dogs orient themselves toward the poles while relieving themselves. 'It is still enigmatic why the dogs do align at all, whether they do it 'consciously' (i.e., whether the magnetic field is [sensorially] perceived (the dogs 'see', 'hear' or 'smell' the compass direction or perceive it as a haptic stimulus) or whether its reception is controlled on the vegetative level (they 'feel better/more comfortable or worse/less comfortable' in a certain direction) [ sic : missing parenthesis],' they wrote.

3," The number of illegal immigrants arriving via the Obamabus program to a New Mexico facility already housing and caring for thousands of others who came before them is expected to increase in the coming weeks, according to reports. And with this will come more disease, as many of the fresh detainees are reportedly stricken with exotic diseases and, worse, don't seem to care much for their own health and hygiene. The New American says the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) detention facility, located in Artesia, New Mexico, is expecting a new shipment of illegal aliens now that a chickenpox quarantine has been lifted. Back in May and June, roughly 10,000 new children per month were being admitted to the facility, with that number dropping off to around 3,100 in August, according to The Washington Times . But more immigrants are on the way following an announcement that all but 68 of the earlier detainees have now been released into the general public. This is a problem, as many of the families still there have serious health problems, such as difficulty using the bathroom, and lack common sense in how to properly dispose of urine- and feces-soiled bath tissue. 'Family unit illnesses and unfamiliarity with bathroom facilities continued to result in unsanitary conditions,' wrote Inspector General John Roth in a recent memo to DHS Secretary Jeh Johnson. 'If detainees do not attend sick call or stand in line to receive daily medications, they remain sick and their illnesses tend to get worse.' How much longer will Americans tolerate this war being waged against them by domestic enemies in DC? According to The New American , roughly 63,000 unaccompanied children from Central America entered the U.S. illegally between October 2013 and July 2014, with the help of DHS of course. This is double the number that was brought in the year prior, and many more this time around are arriving ill with communicable diseases like scabies and chickenpox, as well as lice. Ideally, these children crossing the border illegally will eventually appear in court for hearings about gaining legal immigration status. But this year, the Obama Administration facilitated a massive increase in the number of illegal aliens pouring across the border, and actually used taxpayer-funded buses to escort them to detention facilities, where they have actively spread disease. This, combined with the sudden outbreaks of enteroviruses like EV-D68, suggests that the Obama Administration is waging a war against the American people, one that specifically targets their health . It is no coincidence that this sudden uptick in illegal immigration directly corresponds with multiple enterovirus disease outbreaks that are sickening and killing Americans. As you may recall from earlier in the year, the Obama Administration posted a notice to the federal job site FedBizOpps.gov looking for 'Escort Services for Unaccompanied Alien Children.' The notice sought new government employees who would be willing to accommodate the transport of illegal immigrants to 'Refugee Resettlement shelters located throughout the continental United States.' The fact that these folks are even being referred to as 'refugees' delineates that they gained illegal entry into the U.S. And since the Obama Administration actively engaged in transporting these refugees, it, too, has acted illegally, betraying the American people and committing a form of treason against them, a crime punishable by death. And the treason is only expected to intensify. 'The White House signaled that, as least for now, it sees the flow of children -- which it predicts will more than double in 2015 -- as an issue to be managed rather than a problem to be fought,' claimed The Washington Times back in June.

3," The Mississippi River continues to rise, and many areas around Memphis, Tenn., as well as in other states, have already been evacuated. Reports indicate that the Mississippi River has already crested 14 feet above flood stage, and it has done so days before experts predicted it. At the current accelerated rate of flooding, the river will exceed the 1937 flood record, which rose 14.7 feet above flood stage and destroyed 20 million acres of land, within just a few days ( http://www.nydailynews.com/news/national/201... ). 'This water that we're seeing coming by is moving two million cubic feet per second,' explained Col. Vernie Reichling from the US Army Corps of Engineers (ACE) to reporters. 'To use an analogy, in one second that water would fill up a football field 44 feet deep.' Other reports indicate that Vicksburg, Miss., is expected to see record cresting of 57.5 feet on May 18 in that area ( http://beta.clarionledger.com/article/201105... ), and all along the river, towns and cities are having to prepare as best they can for the coming floods. ACE has already detonated the Birds Point levee in Missouri ( http://www.selfnews.com/032259_New_Madrid... ), released the Bonnet Carre Spillway in New Orleans ( http://edition.cnn.com/2011/US/05/09/midwest... ), and it may demolish several other levees as well in an attempt to divert flood waters from cities and towns. 'We cannot get to the parks, which is underwater, or to other towns,' said one man from Murphysboro, Ill., to CNN. 'Most of the roads are closed, plus the water sewage plant is getting sandbagged. (If) the sewage plant shuts down, we won't have tap water to bathe in or drink.' Many areas of Memphis are already flooded or beginning to flood, and officials have been going door-to-door urging area residents in high-risk areas to evacuate. The worst is yet to come, however, as flood waters are expected to continue rising, affecting at least four million people living in and around the Mississippi River region stretching from Illinois all the way down to the Gulf of Mexico.

3," A Yale study is shining new light on the complexity of the canine mind. In more ways than one, man's best friend is trying to communicate with his master. Dogs not only observe human behavior but seem to engage in a moral evaluation of the people nearest them. Yale Researchers have put hundreds of dogs to the test in new cognitive interactive studies that investigate just how the canine's mind's function. Laurie Santos, director of the Yale Canine Cognition Center, says that hundreds of dogs were placed in front of puppet shows that would typically evoke an emotional response. The dogs responded to the puppets' actions in interesting ways that point to their ability to morally evaluate. 'Dogs are just fascinating,' Santos said. 'We love them, they live in our homes. Anyone who hangs out with a dog is kind of wondering, 'what are they thinking, do they love me'.' Dogs dislike bully-like activity Some tests proved that dogs do show empathetic love in certain situations. In one puppet show cognitive test, each dog watched as a rat puppet helped a hedgehog puppet up a hill. During another test, dogs watched as that same rat puppet knocked the hedgehog puppet back down the hill. 'Similar studies have been done with human infants, and what we find is that infants don't like the guy who was mean,' Santos said. 'So, we're doing the same thing with dogs to try and see if dogs morally evaluate, the way humans do.' Just like infants, most canines in the study became wary of the rat puppet who knocked the hedgehog puppet down the hill. Dogs become wary of thieves, mischievous activity In another test, the dogs were placed in front of a companion sitting and reading a book. When the companion sat the book down on the floor behind their chair, a stranger was allowed into the room to take the book. 'What we really want to see is whether or not dogs know when we've missed some information,' Santos said. 'Do they realize that, first of all, and when they do realize it, are they motivated to help?' The common theme that the canine's shared was their ability to recognize that something was wrong when a stranger came in to take the book. Furthermore, the dogs seemed to take their care to another level. Most attempted to alert their companions that something was wrong. The dogs' ability to not only pay attention but also to recognize that something is wrong indicates that they can morally evaluate people in the room they are in. Dogs care about what their companion values In a third test, Yale researchers allowed a dog and their companion in a room. While the two are relaxing, a researcher walks in and introduces a new object to both. Researchers attempted to see whether the dog would become interested in the same item as their companion. Most of the dogs studied did take a liking to the new object along with their companion. 'The most surprising thing so far is how many of our intuitions about dogs are right,' Yale junior Rebecca Spaulding said. 'That dogs have feelings and dogs want to communicate with us.' ",1
3," The protests and demonstrations currently taking place on the campus of the formerly sedate University of Missouri are rife with hypocrisy and irony for any fair-minded person who wishes to take a serious look at what's actually going on. In the 1950s and 1960s, African Americans would have loved to have had fair-minded coverage of their struggle for civil rights during what became one of the most tumultuous periods in U.S. history since the end of the Civil War. Today, however, on the campus of MU, they are joining Left-wing radicals who are part of the university in chasing the media away, and resorting to force if necessary because suddenly, the media doesn't make them feel 'safe.' In recent days, a mob of protesters gathered on the university's main quad to cheer the resignation of Mizzou president Tim Wolfe after he announced that he was stepping down from his post (which he was essentially forced out of). Students complained about an alleged lack of action over hurt feelings in recent months, including allegations that racial slurs were used against students of color and the discovery of a swastika made of feces in a dorm bathroom. 'My motivation in making this decision comes from love,' Wolfe said to reporters and others following his announcement. 'I love MU, Columbia where I grew up, the state of Missouri.' Behaving as the intolerant mob they used to detest His resignation was followed by that of the school's chancellor, R. Bowen Loftin, who said he was going to transition into a research position. These were the major demands of students the resignation of Wolfe, especially but as it turns out, the intolerance of the mob has only grown and, some observers say, will spread to other institutions around the country. As reported by The Daily Beast , protesters many of them African American formed a human circle around the main protest site, public property which they claimed as their 'safe' zone, refusing to allow media personnel inside to interview participants and take photos. On several occasions, protesters got physical with reporters and cameramen, pushing them back and walling them off with a phalanx of bodies and shouting them down when the reporters claimed the right to occupy public space. 'We calling the police because you aren't respecting us,' shouted one protester at a member of the media, while ironically joining in to disrespect the reporters. 'This guy shouldn't be here,' said another protester, who was later identified on Twitter as Dr. Melissa A. Click , Assistant Professor of Mass Media in the university's Communications Department (talk about irony). She shuffled a member of the press outside the immense circle of linked arms shouting, 'And don't let him back in!' Today's 'civil rights movement' isn't about 'equality' Others then began a brief chant of 'No Comment,' while still another protested claimed, 'They'd just get the headline wrong anyway,' not realizing for a second that by helping others deny reporters' First Amendment rights, they were in the process of making headlines already. Even some members of the Mizzou football team, including both black and white players, joined in and said they would not play another snap unless changes were made and Wolfe resigned. Now that he has, the team members have rejoined the program though the act likely cost the team some alumni support and created future recruiting problems. One player, ESPN reported, even said that half the team members and coaches were not supportive of the walkout, that they were actually 'pissed' about it, and that it wouldn't have happened if the team's record this year was better. 'If we were 9-0, this wouldn't be happening,' the player, who is white but was not identified, told the sports network. Demands have also grown; here is a list of them . Included are 'demands' for Wolfe to 'acknowledge his white male privilege'; implement racial reforms dating back to 1969 and 'comprehensive racial awareness and inclusion curriculum' that is 'mandatory' for all 'students, faculty, staff, and administration' and administrated by 'a board comprised of students, staff, and faculty of color'; and implement 'a strategic 10 year plan by May 1, 2016 that will increase retention rates for marginalized students' (in other words, allow failing students to remain and actually graduate, even though they have not achieved passing academic standards). In the 1950s and 1960s, African Americans had legitimate cause to protest and seek additional civil rights guarantees, but those rights have long been established and numerous additional protections have been added since. Today, many still act as though the civil rights movement never took place, but they are no longer demanding 'equality,' either. They are demanding they be treated better than everyone else, and frankly, that's not 'equality' that's racism, precisely what they claim to be battling.

3," Weight Watchers, Fit Female Club, Jenny Craig...etc. whichever weight loss program you choose it seems they all add up to weight loss via their low-fat or low-carbohydrate diets. Recent research has determined that there is little difference among the weight loss programs used (which were unnamed in the study). The important thing was getting people to adhere to the diets and sticking with it; personalizing it to fit the dieter's needs. As is always the case with weight loss, the most important thing the study found was that the diet must be easy for the individuals to stick to and it must be sustainable for an extended period of time. The Study The research, which was published in JAMA, did a meta-analysis on over 50 long term trials (of at least 12 months) which encompassed over 7,300 people. The analysis found (of course) that dieters witnessed significantly more weight loss than non-dieters. After 6 months the low-carb dieters lost a median weight of 19.2 pounds, while the low-fat dieters lost 17.6 pounds, with both having similar results after 12 months (losing around 16 more pounds each). The great part about the study is that it depicts that one size doesn't fit everyone and that you should get on a plan that is tailored to fit your individual needs so you can more easily adhere to it. One member of the research team, Dr. Bradley C. Johnston of the Hospital for Sick Children Research Institute said, 'Our findings suggest that patients may choose, among those associated with the largest weight loss, the diet that gives them the least challenges with adherence.' Dieting Evolution This highlights that your diet doesn't have to be incredibly restrictive as this usually leads to dropout. In fact, severely restrictive dieting can have several adverse health effects like muscle loss, nutrition deficiency, episodes of over-eating and even weight gain. In order to teach yourself how to eat healthier it was recently determined that a good way to do this is to keep the things you love in your diet . You can do this by decreasing their portion size while increasing the portion size of healthy foods (vegetables, fruits, quality protein), enabling you to teach your brain (and you) how to eat healthier. It basically helps quench your urges/cravings for the things you love by still letting you have small portions. Wrap-Up It seems that as long as you eat a balanced diet, no matter if you choose a low carb or low fat diet, you can still achieve substantial results as long as you can adhere to it! As Dr. Linda Van Horn, R.D., at Northwestern University said, 'Choosing the best diet suited to an individual's food preferences may help foster adherence, but beyond weight loss, diet quality including micronutrient composition may further benefit longevity.'

3," Officials with Riverside County, Calif., removed a newborn baby from her mother without a valid reason or a court-ordered warrant, a practice that the county does very often, according to claims made by the mother in a federal class action lawsuit. The lead plaintiff in the suit, known as 'A.A.,' which is the baby, filed suit against the county, Juvenile Dependency Investigator Karla Torres, Torres' supervisor Felicia M. Butler, and 'all similarly situated county social workers and investigators' Dec. 12, Courthouse News Service reported. The plaintiff's attorney, Shawn McMillan, told the news service that his firm, which focuses on civil rights cases against government child protective agencies, 'uncovered an alarming trend' about one year ago while undergoing discovery for other cases. 'County child welfare agencies regularly subvert the constitutional rights of parents and children by seizing children from their parents when there is no danger to the child, and in fact no need to seize the child at all,' McMillan told Courthouse News Service . 'The class action is designed to address a procedural problem. They [Riverside County social workers] as a matter of course don't get warrants before seizing kids,' he continued. 'Deficient policies, deficient training and deficient supervision all lead to civil rights violations on a regular basis. This lawsuit is designed to address the problem.' Child was healthy and in no danger The 27-page suit claims that A.A. is just one of thousands of children who were wrongfully taken away from their parents by the county's social workers. 'In February 2013, when she was three days old, plaintiff A.A. was snatched by an employee of the Riverside County Department of Public Social Services literally from the breast of her mother as they lay in the hospital recuperating from a successful, safe delivery,' the complaint said. The child 'was healthy and in no danger whatever; her mother has no history of drug, alcohol, or tobacco use nor any history of psychiatric treatment,' the suit says. Further, the county 'had unlawfully seized (A.A.'s) four siblings months before and sent them into foster care,' the suit continues. It also claims that 'thousands of other children' have been taken by Riverside County's child agencies 'without any sort of warrant and without any risk of serious injury.' The suit notes that Tonita Rogers gave birth to A.A. via Caesarean section and then spent a few days recovering and bonding with her newborn. Rogers, in the suit, claims she was in good health and 'fully capable of taking care' of the child. In fact, three days later, Torres came to her hospital room and was able to see that she was recovering very well and that her newborn was healthy, the complaint states. 'Despite these facts, and solely because there had been an earlier dependency petition filed regarding plaintiffs' siblings, Torres seized the newborn baby plaintiff from her mother's care and custody,' says the complaint. They ought to know better Rogers says that Torres 'did not bother to seek a warrant,' which the complaint states would have likely taken about two hours. Torres also did not seek an ex parte petition for non-custodial removal before taking A.A., it says. McMillan told the news service that A.A. was returned to Rogers five to ten days later. He added that a number of seized children are taken out of their mothers' care for a year or more. He noted that half of his firm's cases involve African American children like A.A., and 'a large portion' are from poorer families. But he noted that white and upper-class parents were still not 'immune' from the problem, and that some of his firm's cases involved 'medical doctors and investment bankers.' Plaintiffs maintain that county social workers ought to know better than taking children without a warrant, as such behavior is illegal and in violation of basic civil rights protections. Further, the complaint says the county 'turned a blind eye' to what its social workers were doing.

3," Army Veteran Donald Siefkin wasn't asking for much when he called the emergency room at the Seattle VA Hospital on February 27. The 64-year-old was parked just a few feet from the ER entrance and was in severe pain from a broken foot he had suffered earlier that day. The pain was getting worse, and his foot swelled to the 'size of a football' on a 3.5-hour drive to the Seattle-Tacoma airport from his home in Kennewick, Washington. While preparing to take his wife to the airport to catch a red-eye flight, Siefkin had 'stepped down funny and heard a snap.' During the drive, the swelling and pain increased so he decided to head straight for the Seattle VA hospital to seek medical care before attempting to drive back home. By the time Siefkin reached the hospital parking lot at around 3:30 am, the pain had become excruciating, so he called the emergency room front desk to request assistance getting inside. He could no longer walk because of the swelling and the pain, and he needed someone to bring a wheelchair and push him inside the building. This sounds like a manageable request, right? The hospital employee who answered the phone refused Siefkin's request. After a brief argument, the employee told him, 'No, we're not going to come get you. You're going to have to call 911 and you'll have to pay for that.' The employee then hung up on him. A Seattle Times article about the incident says: By 3:47 a.m., a Seattle fire captain and three firefighters manning Engine Company 30 arrived to wheel Siefken into the ER. Staff members examined him, took X-rays, put a boot on his foot and prescribed Hydrocodone for his pain. Siefken, who declined to take the medication for fear he'd be unsafe to drive, drove back home to Kennewick after the hospital wouldn't put him up for the night. He arrived four hours later, took a painkiller and crawled into bed. When initial inquiries were made about the case, Chad Hutson, spokesman for the Veteran Affairs Puget Sound Health Care System, said: 'I know it sounds counterintuitive because someone is just 10 feet away, but it is our policy to do that.' Later, however, the VA contradicted that statement and issued a written apology, which stated in part: When the Veteran told our emergency room staff that he did not have an urgent or emergent medical issue, our staff should have considered the request for help as a patient assistance issue. The emergency room personnel should have called the appropriate staff to come and assist the patient, ensuring he made it into the emergency room safely. Siefkin was satisfied with the apology, saying: They said they're sorry and they're going to change things so this doesn't happen again. That's all I really wanted.' Siefkin's experience was far from the worst that the men and women who served our country have endured in recent years. Thousands of complaints have been filed against the VA, and in many cases, veterans have died while waiting to receive treatment or have been killed due to malpractice on the part of VA doctors and staff. This case is just a clear illustration of how absurd and wrong-headed VA policies and practices can be. This incident begs the question: how can President Obama justify busing illegal aliens thousands of miles to drop them off in U.S. cities, when a VA hospital can't even wheel an injured vet 10 feet to receive medical care? After all, both are the responsibility of the Executive Branch. Sources: http://www.seattletimes.com ",4
3," Here's a Merry Christmas to all the selfnews readers from the Health Ranger. And yes, I do specifically mean Merry Christmas. I don't mean just 'Happy Holidays' or 'happy winter break' or even 'happy end-of-year time off.' What I mean is Merry Christmas. That's the holiday name I grew up with and I'm sticking to it. :-) On this merry Christmas, I feel compelled to comment about the ongoing effort to sterilize the English language by removing any words that might dare to impart meaning. I've read reports that certain people feel 'offended' by the term Christmas, and I've watched as public schools have morphed their own descriptions of the Christmas break, removing the word 'Christmas' and replacing it with 'Holiday' as in 'Holiday break' or 'winter break.' The politically-correct language police have, once again, gone too far. This effort to sterilize the language of Christmas only serves to dumb down the children and remove any real meaning from words so that nobody might choose to feel offended by them. Words that say nothing, it seems, are more acceptable in our modern world where political correctness trumps authentic communication. The problem with this approach is that when you sterilize the language, you also remove most of the meaning from the words, leaving an empty shell of strung-together syllables that are designed to say absolutely nothing. Imagine the boss uttering the following at the office Christmas party: 'We are calling this meeting to ascertain the various aspects of this particular time of the year which has been noted by some as deriving itself from an embracing of a period of non-work during which some small gifts may be voluntarily exchanged among persons who optionally feel they wish to do so, but no such gift may exceed a value of twenty dollars, and no gifts may be exchanged that have any particular connotation or personal intent.' This is the sterile, idiotic language environment in which much of America is now suffocating. Use words to communicate, not to placate When it comes to words, you really have two choices: Choice #1) Say nothing . Bite your tongue, sterilize your words, surrender to political correctness and live your life as an entirely ineffectual and spineless word weasel (you can also run for Congress if you're any good at this...) Choice #2) Say what you mean . Use words with purpose while running the risk that somebody somewhere will have an issue with your words, but so what? If people decide to feel offended from your uttering of a holiday name, that's their choice -- NOT your responsibility. This is more of a Jesse Ventura approach. I obviously selected choice #2 many years ago, which is why today I'm saying Merry Christmas . And for those who don't observe the Christmas holiday, Happy Holidays to you! Give yourself the gift of good health One of the best gifts you can give yourself this Christmas, by the way, is the gift of good health. And here at selfnews, we're here to help you accomplish that: In a few days, I'm going to be publishing a list of 50 ways to improve your health in 2010. But if you're a regular reader of selfnews, you probably already know most of what's going to be on that list, so I encourage you to find a balance this year between having a fun celebration and keeping your diet as healthy as possible at the same time. And I'll let you in on a little secret: For a very special occasion like Christmas , I'll even eat some homemade sweets if they're offered to me by family or friends. If you follow a super healthy diet most of the year, there's no harm in relaxing a bit and enjoying some of the more celebratory foods during the holiday season / Christmas season. You don't have to eat just salads and superfoods every single day of the year, you know! But if you do eat some of the more sugared-up, processed foods that you know aren't good for you, use the same defense I do: Chow down some chlorella, spirulina or blue-green algae before you eat the more junky stuff, and you'll go a long way towards protecting yourself from the worst effects of not-so-healthy food. There's a lot of stuff I wouldn't dare touch during a Christmas dinner -- the Christmas ham, for example. Not for me, no thanks! But for the stuff I will eat, like homemade Christmas cookies, they're always accompanied by superfoods, including astaxanthin , resveratrol, oregano oil, berry tinctures or medicinal herbs. So enjoy your Christmas! (Or your holiday, if you don't celebrate Christmas.) Kick back, relax a little, and protect your health with superfoods! Then get ready to rock 'n roll with a new healthy YOU in 2010! We'll be bringing you lots of amazing news and strategies for making 2010 the healthiest year of your life. ",4
3," Tweet (NewsTarget) The bird flu has struck South Korea after three years of little to no activity. The H5N1 virus is a highly virulent strain that could potentially spread to and kill humans. South Korea's Agriculture Ministry said earlier this week it suspected bird flu had killed 6,000 chickens at a farm in the southwest of the country that lies on a path for migratory birds. A Ministry official said 'It is the H5N1 strain' after seeing test results from the suspected case. After the results were reported, the Agriculture Ministry ordered the culling of 236,000 poultry within a 1,640-foot radius of the farm in South Korea's North Cholla province, which is located about 100 miles from Seoul. In addition, quarantine authorities also banned the shipment of more than 5 million poultry from 221 farms within a 6.2-mile radius of the farm. No signs of human infection had been spotted or reported among local residents or quarantine officials, according to another Agriculture Ministry official. Between December 2003 and March 2004 -- about 400,000 poultry at South Korean farms were infected by bird flu. That recent history has caused concern on this latest case, because during the outbreak from 2003, South Korea culled 5.3 million birds -- and spent about $1.6 billion on preventing the disease from spreading. After the 2003 South Korean outbreak, tests in the U.S. indicated that at least nine South Korean workers involved in the cull had been infected with the H5N1 virus. However, none of the infected workers developed major illnesses. Since 2003, outbreaks have been confirmed in around 50 countries and territories around the globe. The World Health Organization said that by Nov. 13 of this year, there had been 258 cases of human infection of the H5N1 strain since 2003, resulting in 153 deaths. Many of the H5N1 victims were in Asia, with 98 deaths in Vietnam and Indonesia. ### ",4
3," A recent survey of hospitals found that infections, surgical errors and other medical harm contribute to the deaths of about 180,000 patients a year. The projections by Consumer Reports magazine were based on a 2010 report by the Department of Health and Human Resources. In addition to the deaths, the government report found that another 1.4 million patients are seriously hurt by their hospital care. What is most interesting about these results is that they cover just a small sample; the figures pertain only to Medicare patients. What happens to other patients is less clear, the magazine said, because most hospital errors don't get reported and hospitals only report a small fraction of what can go wrong. 'There is an epidemic of health-care harm,' Rosemary Gibson, a patient-safety advocate and author, said. 'Hospitals haven't given safety the attention it deserves' She adds that somewhere in the neighborhood of 2.25 million Americans will probably die from medical harm this decade. 'That's like wiping out the entire populations of North Dakota, Rhode Island and Vermont. It's a man-made disaster,' she said. Some hospitals are responding to this crisis by implementing new safety measures such as electronically prescribing medications to help prevent drug errors and checklists to prevent infections - with some success. Since 2008, rates of central-line bloodstream infections, for instance, have fallen off by 32 percent, says the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention . That's a start, but much more needs to be done, industry experts say. 'Hospitals haven't given safety the attention it deserves,' notes Peter Pronovost, M.D., senior VP for patient safety and quality at Johns Hopkins Medicine in Baltimore. The government hasn't made it a priority either, he added. 'Medical harm is probably one of the three leading causes of death in the U.S., but the government doesn't adequately track it as it does deaths from automobiles, plane crashes, and cancer. It's appalling,' he told the magazine. The dearth of information, he says, not only makes it harder to identify and define the extent of the problem but also creates challenges for patients who are trying to learn more about the safety of hospitals in their communities. That's where Consumer Reports stepped up. For the first time, in August 2012, the magazine rated hospitals for safety, utilizing the most current data available. The analysis includes data from both government and independent sources on 1,159 hospitals in 44 states. For their report, the magazine said it 'also interviewed patients, physicians, hospital administrators, and safety experts; reviewed medical literature; and looked at hospital inspections and investigations.' That said, the ratings still only include 18 percent of U.S. hospitals because data on patient harm is still not fully reported or available consistently nationwide. 'Hospitals that volunteer safety information, regardless of their score, deserve credit, since the first step in safety is accountability,' John Santa, M.D., director of the Consumer Reports Health Ratings Center , said. 'But the fact that consumers can't get a full picture of most hospitals in the U.S. underscores the need for more public reporting.' All hospitals have something bad about them To make its determinations, the magazine focused on six things: infections, readmissions, communication, CT scanning, complications, and mortality. Not all health professionals agreed with the ratings scheme. Readmission rates, for instance, could be higher among hospitals care for patients who then have little home or community support after being discharged. Some of the most important findings include: -- There are bad things that happen in all hospitals. But the difference is, in terms of ratings, bad things happen in some hospitals more often than others. Consumer Reports said: 'The lowest--scoring hospital, Sacred Heart Hospital in Chicago, earned just a 16 on our 100-point safety scale and reported a rate of bloodstream -infections that was more than twice the national benchmark. The hospital declined to comment.' -- Even hospitals with high ratings/scores can do better. The Billings Clinic in Montana was at the top of the magazine's safety ratings list, but it only got a 72 (out of a possible 100). -- Some well-known hospitals have less-than-stellar safety scores (including Massachusetts General in Boston and Ronald Reagan UCLA Medical Center in Los Angeles). The American Association of Justice - formerly the Association of Trial Lawyers of America - says preventable medical errors are the sixth-biggest killer in the country.

3," As many areas of the country perspire their way through record-breaking summer heat, staying hydrated is of the essence, as is keeping your body nourished with life-giving, health-promoting superfoods. And since warm and hot foods are not always desirable during this time of year, here are a few 'cool' superfood ideas to help you beat the heat and nurture your palate. Cucumbers - Fibrous and mostly composed of water, the cucumber is one of the most effective 'cooling' foods as its juice helps to lower body temperature. Cucumber seeds also contain cucurbitin, an amino acid, linoleic acid, and various other fatty acids that soothe the body both internally and externally. Try slicing some cucumbers for breakfast, or making a cucumber sandwich for lunch -- you might be surprised at how healthy you feel. Melons - Gently sweet and refreshingly succulent, watermelon, honeydew, and cantaloupe are among the most popular summertime melons. Each one is composed of roughly 95 percent water, and about five percent natural fruit sugar. Melons are also rich in varying levels of vital enzymes, vitamins and minerals, and electrolytes, which make them an ideal food for replenishing the water and nutrients lost while sweating on those hot summer days. Strawberries - An iconic summertime treat, the strawberry is refreshing, nutritious, and delicious. The fruit, which is a member of the rose family, is high in vitamin C, the trace mineral manganese, antioxidants, and various other nutrients and enzymes that promote good health . Just be sure to buy pesticide-free or organic strawberries rather than conventional, as the latter tend to be among the most toxic when it comes to chemical contamination. Radishes - You may not necessarily think of them as an ideal summertime treat, but radishes are actually an excellent addition to your healthy, summertime diet. A powerful cleansing vegetable, the radish is both pungent and sweet, depending on the variety, and can be eaten raw, or added to salads or gazpachos. You can also throw some radishes into a pilaf or cucumber salad for a tasty, filling snack that will help stimulate healthy digestion and promote healthy liver and gallbladder function. Mint - There are so many unique ways to use mint, particularly when it comes to summertime beverages and light fare, that a quick snippet on this healing herb hardly does it justice. But it is worth mentioning, as mint can be added to tea, lemonade, vegetables salads, marinades, smoothies, sorbets, and cocktails. Rich in fiber, iron, copper, calcium, folic acid, and omega-3 fatty acid concentrates, mint not only livens up food and beverages, but it also calms intestinal inflammation and fights harmful bacteria. Chia seeds - Popularized by the well-known television infomercial for the pet by the same name, chia is a hydrating, rejuvenating, and lubricating superfood seed that provides lasting energy and sustained vigor, even during the heat of the day. Try adding soaked or gelled chia seeds to things like smoothies, juices, breakfast cereals, and salads to up your intake of omega-3 fatty acids, and ease inflammation throughout your body. ",1
3," Historically, the local county sheriff has been considered to be the highest authority in the land, wielding more power than city, state and even federal authorities. In Delaware; however, that power is under attack, according to one of the state's three county authorities. Sheriff Jeffrey Christopher says when he was elected to office in 2010, he believed he was supposed to represent his constituents as the highest-ranking law enforcement authority in the county. Instead, he has landed smack dab in the middle of a battle for the future of an American law enforcement precedent dating back to the founding of the nation, the American Free Press reported. 'It is one more example of federal and state governments ignoring the will of the people as well state laws. In the case of Delaware, the state's own constitution stipulates that the office of the sheriff is a constitutionally created position just like the secretary of state and the attorney general,' the web publication reported. 'Delaware's Constitution states: 'The sheriffs shall be conservators of the peace within the counties . . . in which they reside.'' 'The others won't stand up with me' The Delaware initiative is being headed by state Attorney General Beau Biden, who is, perhaps not so ironically, the son of Vice President Joe Biden. The report said Biden's office has sent out mandates to county commissioners informing them their sheriffs no longer have powers of arrest. Moreover, AFP said, the position of Biden's office has been seconded by State Solicitor L.W. Lewis, who said in an opinion released a year ago that neither state nor common law grants arrest powers to local county sheriffs . In reality; however, the office of the sheriff was created in the American colonies well before the nation's official founding. In fact, AFP said, Delaware's first sheriff held office in 1669. In a January 2012 interview, Christopher told AFP that the two prior sheriff administrations, dating back as far as 2000, both noticed reductions in funding and the erosion of their offices in general. 'Now my deputies and I have been relieved of all arrest powers and can't even make a traffic stop,' he said. ' Delaware has only three counties. . . The other two sheriffs...will not stand up with me' to prevent the elimination of county law enforcement, Christopher added. The sheriff said the lack of authority vested in his office really came to light during an incident involving a county councilman, Vance Phillips. Christopher said he was struck in the eye and kicked by the councilman but could not arrest him. Bumping off another uniquely American precedent 'I want to recreate the office in the way it was intended,' Christopher, a Republican, told The Huffington Post . 'A sheriff is supposed to be out there responding to the wishes of the people, just as the police do. Most people want to see more of a presence of law enforcement.' Delaware sheriffs traditionally conduct foreclosure sales and deliver court papers, local TV affiliate WBOC reported. While Christopher says his bid to increase the power of his office is rooted in the state's constitution, opponents say he is misinterpreting the phrase. Nevertheless, HuffPo said Christopher has allowed his deputies to chase down felons and other criminals. 'He continues to say he's law enforcement, and he's not,' says state House Majority Leader Pete Schwartzkopf, a Democrat, who introduced a bill last year specifically denying sheriffs the ability to arrest suspects and investigate crimes. 'It's not a good position to be in, to have no authority over a person who carries a gun. It's scary.' Actually, what's truly 'scary' is that yet another uniquely American precedent is being steamrollered by statist politicians who have empowered themselves to do so.

3," Emerging research into a rare kind of fat cell known as brown fat may lead to new medical interventions to fight obesity. Researchers have known for some time of the existence of brown fat in newborn mammals. Unlike the more common white fat, which stores energy, brown fat actually releases energy in order to help heat the body. With the recent discovery that some brown fat cells also exist in adult humans, researchers have begun to wonder whether it might be used to help obese people lose weight. In two studies recently published in the journal Nature , researchers explored the bodily mechanisms that regulate brown fat. In the first, a team of researchers from the Dana-Farber Cancer Institute in Boston built on its previous finding that a specific gene transcription factor known as PRDM16 helps regulate the activity of brown fat cells. When the researchers removed that transcription factor from immature brown fat cells, the cells immediately turned into muscle. 'What we show in this paper is kind of a big shock,' researcher Bruce Spiegelman said. 'We show that brown fat is derived from a muscle-like cell, and that brown fat and white fat are completely different.' Previously, the same team showed that the addition of PRDM16 could cause white fat cells to turn into brown fat. They are now investigating whether a pharmaceutical drug could be used to stimulate the activity of PRDM16 and encourage the body to make more brown fat. In a second study, researchers from the Joslin Diabetes Center, also in Boston, injected a bone growth protein called BMP-7 into the bodies of mice by means of a virus. The mice that had been injected with BMP-7 subsequently developed more brown fat cells and gained less weight than mice that had not been injected. The same result occurred when researchers transplanted BMP-7-treated immature brown fat cells into adult mice. Sources for this story include: www.reuters.com . ",4
3," No matter how many times we say, 'I'll never do that again!' when we imbibe in alcohol a little too much, for many there is, sadly, a next time. And a next. And each time, people seem to want to try new and better ways to ease the pain of the inevitable hangover -- techniques that are rooted in legend, old wives' tales and the words of the barroom physician. By the way, the peak of so-called morning after pain occurs at 29 years old, says a recent study from Denmark. Well, to date, there is no 'cure' for the common hangover, though there are some 'treatments,' so to speak. Among them, according to About.com : -- Sleep -- Liquids (because you're dehydrated) like vegetable and fruit drinks coupled with water -- Vitamin C (try some organic orange juice) -- Eat, even if you don't feel like it; mineral- and protein-rich foods are best Now, on to those 'cures' that don't work, as compiled by Men's Health magazine: 'Hair of the dog that bit you' : A morning-after shot of whiskey or Bloody Mary? Well, that may numb your pain, but it's temporary, according to Gary Murray, acting director of the National Institute of Alcohol Abuse and Alcoholism's (NIAAA) Division of Metabolism and Health Effects. Taking another drink (or a few more drinks) will only delay the wearing-off effect of your bender. Rehydrating is crucial; alcohol will further dehydrate. Have a greasy breakfast : Think loading up on sausage, eggs and hash browns will help absorb whatever alcohol is left? Nope, because there is no alcohol left by the time you wake up. And in truth, greasy, non-organic, processed food -- besides being incredibly bad for your body -- is likely to accomplish only one thing: giving you heartburn. But again, as stated above, certain foods are better than others. The old standby, coffee : 'There is a cognitive impairment that results from a hangover--a brain fog, which impairs your ability to perform,' Murray says. And while a tad bit of coffee might make you a bit more alert because of the caffeine, coffee is also a major diuretic and, again, you're already badly dehydrated from too much alcohol consumption . Water is better. Have a late-night meal before turning in (wasted) : The theory here is, again, a late-night meal will help absorb the alcohol in your system and therefore ease the pain of getting up in the morning. But in truth, says Murray, 'Eating after you've already been drinking isn't going to help absorb or metabolize the alcohol.' Actually, the trick is to eat a solid meal before you're too many drinks into your evening, because food helps slow the rate at which your body absorbs alcohol, thereby releasing it into your bloodstream at a slower, and far better, rate. Just lie around in bed all day : That isn't effective. Murray told Men's Health , 'studies have shown that the intoxicated go to bed roughly 2 hours later than sober people on the same night.' So, 'fatigue, headache, irritability--these are all symptoms of a hangover , but also of sleep deprivation.' The better option is to grab a couple of more hours of sleep and experience another REM cycle that you likely missed the night before. After that, get up, get around and about and wake yourself up, and Murray says you'll feel much better. Just sweat it out with exercise : Um, you can't really 'sweat it out,' because the culprit -- alcohol -- has already left your system. Still, increasing your basal metabolic rate, or BMR, which is what naturally happens when you exercise, can maybe increase your changes of getting rid of the toxic byproducts. Just pop a couple of painkillers before bed : Not effective. Not only are compounds like aspirin and over-the-counter pain killers like acetaminophen (Tylenol) hazardous in and of themselves and mixed with alcohol, but they can be dangerous even after your body has metabolized the alcohol (which takes about an hour). 'Alcohol turns on specific enzymes in your body that stay present long after you're no longer impaired, even into the next day,' Murray explains. These enzymes can interact dangerously with acetaminophens. The best 'cure'? Avoid over-indulgence in the first place, or, if you didn't, try a natural cure: http://www.selfnews.com .

3," Students attending a panel discussion with Google Chairman Eric Schmidt, that took place at Yale University's School of Management last year, thought they were there to learn more about the globalization of technology. But a video montage of what actually took place at the creepy event reveals that it was actually more of a product placement marketing ploy to promote aspartame-laden Diet Coke. The roughly hour-long panel discussion, which was captured on video, features Schmidt repeatedly touching and fondling a carefully-placed Diet Coke can perched on a table next to his seat. A three-minute condensed video highlighting all the moments that Schmidt gestured towards, touched, or drank from the can clearly reveal that Diet Coke was just as much a featured member of the panel as Schmidt was. Was the can really empty? In the video, Schmidt can be seen awkwardly touching and fondling the can at least five different times, as well as drinking from it at least a dozen times. Each time he picked up or otherwise moved the can, Schmidt was careful to set it back down with the label facing outward in clear view of all the students and the camera filming him. But this isn't the most disturbing part. From the beginning of the discussion to the end, it appears as though there is nothing actually in the Diet Coke can, and that Schmidt is merely pretending to drink from it. Each time he tipped it back to take a drink, Schmidt angled the can roughly the same way every time, suggesting that it is empty. One would think that after taking 12 separate gulps the angle of the can would change, but this wasn't the case. Schmidt clearly angled his can the same way the first time he supposedly took a drink as he did the last time he took a drink. And multiple times throughout the discussion, Schmidt accidentally set the can down too hard, making a sharp clank noise exposing it as empty. You can watch the shocking video here: http://youtu.be/QtXQQXKH9wo Schmidt's Diet Coke stunt encouraged millions to consume poison Interestingly, Schmidt can be heard swallowing a few times in the video, which some have suggested proves there was liquid in the can. But it is very easy to fake a swallow without actually swallowing anything, and to have it make a noise -- try it for yourself! To the honest viewer, it is clear that Schmidt was pretending to drink Diet Coke , and carefully made sure the Diet Coke logo was featured throughout the event. This is an increasingly common marketing tactic for junk food manufacturers, who routinely use celebrities, high-profile businessmen, and other people in the media spotlight to promote their products. In this case, it seems apparent that Schmidt was recruited to endorse Diet Coke by the fact that he pretended to drink it in front of a room full of college students, subconsciously encouraging them to do the same. Diet Coke, as our readers probably well know, is a poisonous beverage loaded with toxic aspartame and other deadly chemicals. This ubiquitous sweetening additive has been linked to heart disease, obesity, and a host of other chronic ailments that Schmidt, if he uses his own search engine to conduct research, should already know as well. But he clearly doesn't care, if he does know, since he shamelessly promoted aspartame while inadvertently exposing himself as a sellout and a shill. selfnews readers know better than to fall for this type of deception, but many others out there who still trust these corporate clowns unfortunately don't.

3," A ranking Food and Drug Administration official is facing four counts of soliciting prostitution and a single count of disorderly conduct stemming from his arrest by Howard County, Md., Police last month. Dr. William Maisel, the deputy director for the Center for Devices and Radiological Health , was nabbed July 13 during an undercover sting operation along a busy corridor in Laurel, reports said. Maisel was one of ten suspected arrested in the operation. In a statement, the agency declined to speculate or comment, saying only, 'This is a personal matter and unrelated to the work of the FDA or Dr. Maisel's work at the agency,' according to spokeswoman Erica Jefferson. 'Dr. Maisel is still employed by the agency and is working.' His mug shot is available here . Maisel, who joined the FDA in 2010, is scheduled for a preliminary court hearing Sept. 20. A smart guy - Just a bad choice Prior to the FDA, Maisel, 46, held prominent positions at Boston's Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center and taught at Harvard Medical School , said reports. According to the website Vitals.com , which profiles physicians, Maisel is a Board-certified cardiologist who attended Cornell Medical College . A separate website belonging to the Medical Device Manufacturer's Association listed additional biographical information: William H. Maisel, MD, MPH is Chief Scientist and Deputy Center Director for Science at FDA's Center for Devices and Radiological Health (CDRH). He is responsible for providing leadership in the development, implementation, execution, management and direction of the Center's broad national and international biomedical science programs. He is also a former chair of the FDA Circulatory System and Post-Market Medical Device Advisory Committees, and is a former member of the Center for Medicare and Medicaid Services Coverage Advisory Committee. Beside his medical degree, he also has a an undergraduate degree in biology from MIT , and a master's in Public Health from the Harvard School of Public Health . 'Maisel joined the agency as its first deputy director for science in 2010, but his interactions with the agency date back to 2003 when he advised the Center for Devices and Radiological Health as a consultant,' said a report in MedCity News . Extensive history and experience Among Maisel's cardiology specialties is arrhythmia - irregular, improper heart rhythms that can cause circulatory problems and even death. Reports suggest Maisel applied his cardiology specialties to the medical devices industry. In 2005, for example, he conducted a study for the FDA that found 20 out of every 1,000 implanted heart defibrillators were malfunctioning, failures which led to some 31 deaths between 1990 and 2002, USA Today reported. The study found there were 2.25 million pacemakers and almost 416,000 implanted cardiac defibrillators, or ICDs, implanted in the United States, the paper said. Of those, 17,000 of them - 8,834 pacemakers and 8,489 ICDs - had to be removed because of malfunctions. In an editorial this year, he touted the agency's role in approving new medical devices. 'Each year, millions of American patients benefit from innovative medical devices that reduce suffering, treat previously untreatable conditions, extend lives, and improve public health. The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) is committed to assuring that patients have timely access to important new technologies and next-generation medical devices without compromising safety,' he wrote. It wasn't clear whether the FDA would retain Maisel at publication time, nor if he planned to plead guilty in court.

3," There is yet another thing that your government didn't tell you about Obamacare and its subsequent expansion of Medicaid: If you enroll in the taxpayer-funded health coverage program through an Obamacare exchange, then, when you die, your estate will be taken by the government. As reported by the Seattle Times : It wasn't the moonlight, holiday-season euphoria or family pressure that made Sofia Prins and Gary Balhorn, both 62, suddenly decide to get married. It was the fine print. As fine print is wont to do, it had buried itself in a long form - Balhorn's application for free health insurance through the expanded state Medicaid program. As the paperwork lay on the dining-room table in Port Townsend, Prins began reading. She was shocked: If you're 55 or over, Medicaid can come back after you're dead and bill your estate for ordinary health-care expenses. Penalizing the poor in the end Suddenly, the Prins no longer saw that obtaining their health insurance through Medicaid was going to be 'free.' Rather, it's more of a loan - one whose requirements to pay back premiums isn't very well advertised. Not only that, the requirement is punitive, as most government mandates are: It penalizes folks who, though they may be poor, have managed to keep a house or accrue some savings they hoped to pass along to heirs. In reality, Medicaid - in compliance with federal policy - has long recouped payouts via estates. But, because the majority of low-income Americans without disabilities couldn't otherwise qualify for typical medical coverage under Medicaid , 'recovery primarily involved expenses for nursing homes and long-term care,' the Times said. Obamacare changed all of that by expanding Medicaid coverage to many more Americans. In Washington state, lawmakers are hearing from distraught and angry constituents as they learn about the great government Medicaid recovery plan that no one told them about. In response, lawmakers are looking at what they can do to repair the clash of state rules with the Affordable Care Act: [Recently] , Gov. Jay Inslee's office and the state Medicaid office said they plan to draft an emergency rule to limit estate recovery to long-term care and related medical expenses. They hope to be able to change the rules before coverage begins Jan. 1. Fixing the problem will cost the state about $3 million a year, said Dr. Bob Crittenden, Inslee's senior health-policy adviser, but it's the right thing to do. 'There was no intent on the part of the ACA to do estate recovery on people going into Medicaid (for health insurance),' Crittenden said. 'The idea was to expand coverage.' 'People will think this is free' The Times said residents in their 50s and 60s currently make up about 30 percent of adults who have signed up through the state's Obamacare exchange. Some residents 55-60 years old who have either taken early retirements or who became unemployed due to the recent recession have now found themselves in a low-income bracket. In the past, in order to qualify for Medicaid, applicants were required to reduce their assets; with the Obamacare expansion, however, now more recipients are better off and more likely to have homes and other assets. Writing in The Washington Times , Dr. Jane Orient, executive director of the politically conservative Association of American Physicians and Surgeons, labeled the recovery provision 'a cash cow for states to milk the poor and the middle class.' 'People will think this is wonderful, this is free insurance,' Orient said in an interview. 'They don't realize it's really a loan, and is secured by any property they have.' She went on to warn that even states that move to limit estate recovery can eventually change the rules again if they begin to have budget shortfalls.

3," A state lawmaker in Tennessee is fed up with President Obama's incessant quest to flood America with as many non-English-speaking and potentially dangerous immigrants he possibly can before stepping down from office in January 2017. So fed up, in fact, that he is calling for a radical measure to rid his state of immigrants who are from parts of the world where terrorism is born and bred get the National Guard involved and round them up, then use the troops to prevent more from entering. 'We need to activate the Tennessee National Guard and stop them from coming in to the state by whatever means we can,' said House GOP Caucus Chairman Glen Casada, a Republican from Franklin and one of the chamber's top members, in reference to Syrian refugees in the state. Casada made his comments following the horrific murder of more than 129 people in Paris, France an attack that involved several members of the Islamic State of Iraq and Syria and which occurred at a half-dozen locations around the capital city. 'Tennessee is a sovereign state' 'I'm not worried about what a bureaucrat in D.C. or an unelected judge thinks. ... We need to gather (Syrian refugees) up and politely take them back to the ICE center and say, 'They're not coming to Tennessee, they're yours,'' he said, as reported by The Tennessean newspaper in its online edition. Casada is practically alone in his call for an all-out effort to send newly arrived refugees back to U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement centers. That said, there is definitely a rising sentiment among the state's lawmakers, and in particular among its Republican majority, to do something to mitigate peoples' fears that at least some of the new arrivals may harbor violent jihadist intentions. Asked to provide details about his plan and whether he seriously believes it is viable, Casada replied: ' Tennessee is a sovereign state. If the federal government is forsaking the obligation to protect our citizens, we need to act.' Some of Tennessee's lawmakers were vehemently opposed to and no doubt gave the appearance of being offended by Casada's call for action. 'I think that is one of the most extraordinarily misguided statements that I have heard made by a public official,' House Democratic Caucus Chairman Mike Stewart, a Democrat from Nashville, told The Tennessean . He has asked the state's attorney general, Herbert Slattery, for an opinion regarding the issue. 'We need to approach this issue from a standpoint of strength and not fear, and we should have great confidence in our military forces and in our law enforcement agencies to keep our citizens safe. We don't need to go off half-cocked and start interfering in the defense policy of our country,' Stewart added. 'They' are heading our way Tennessee is just one state, of course, and what lawmakers there ultimately decide to do will be up to them and their constituents. And Casada's call to use the National Guard to root out and expel refugees is certainly an extreme measure. But according to a new Bloomberg News survey , a clear majority of Americans want President Obama's plan to resettle tens of thousands of Syrian refugees in the U.S. stopped. What is also clear is that tens of millions of Americans share Casada's concern that at least some of the new arrivals to the U.S. from Syria do in fact include violent Islamist extremists . At least one of the operatives involved in the attack had a passport from a Western nation Greece and was known to have traveled back and forth between Europe and the war-torn Syria. Also, U.S. officials working with other governments in our hemisphere have identified several Syrian men with fake passports moving towards the U.S. ( here , in Texas; here , in Honduras; and here , in Costa Rica).

3," Winter is the season of the kidney according to traditional Chinese medicine (TCM). It is especially important to tend to these organs during this time. With a measure of proper care and attention, kidney health is strengthened while painful stones and infections are avoided. Through straightforward dietary and lifestyle choices, the kidneys can be kept clear, untroubled and vigorous. Winter - A season to nourish and rebuild As observed in traditional Chinese medicine, when the kidneys are unbalanced, the emotion of fear arises. The reverse is equally true. When we are in a state of chronic fear or anxiety, the kidneys become depleted. The cold, winter months can aggravate the kidneys further -- it is vital to pay particular attention to these organs during this time. Staying warm (especially the feet) while protecting against chills and cold wind encourages harmony within the kidneys. Enjoying soups, stews and seasonal, grounding vegetables like winter squash maintain kidney equilibrium too. Additionally, a brief meditation from The Organ-Emotion Link helps to balance these tiny bean shaped organs as well: 'Sit in qigong posture for a few minutes, with the eyes lightly closed. Make sure you are relaxed and breathing naturally...Now focus on the kidneys. Let the inhalation fill the kidneys with wisdom, with the confidence of inner knowing - Exhale all fears. Repeat several [times].' Traditional Chinese medicine states that winter is a season of warmth, replenishment and rest -- this is not the time to be cold, stressed or overworked. Robust kidneys are linked with slowing down, nurturing ourselves with seasonal whole foods and bundling up. Modern medicine also addresses kidney health, but in a more diet-focused manner. Kidney health basics We usually don't think about the kidneys as long as both are functioning properly. The kidneys are one of our most important organs, filtering an incredible 200 quarts of blood per day. When disease sets in, whether with kidney stones or an infection, severe pain follows. And kidney stones can lead to serious complications if they become lodged in the urinary tract. This is reason enough to keep these organs zipping along. Luckily, diet is extremely effective in preventing a painful kidney wake-up call. As seen in How to keep your kidneys healthy, happy and stone-free , some of the best foods for the kidneys include: Cranberry Collard greens Spinach Kelp Sesame seeds Sardines Broccoli Aloe vera Garbanzo beans Apple cider vinegar Magnesium Potassium Moreover, freshly made lemonade has been shown to significantly reduce kidney stones. In order to keep these painful crystals at bay, drink four ounces of lemon juice in two liters of purified water each day. According to TCM, green tea, asparagus, garlic, parsley, celery and fish are also beneficial. Drinking plenty of water, reducing both refined salt and excessive protein supports strong kidneys too. Maintaining healthy and happy kidneys not only minimizes distressing and painful maladies, but also fosters fearlessness -- infusing emotional stability into our day-to-day lives. By utilizing the wisdom of traditional Chinese medicine along with modern science, the kidneys can be hardy and thriving throughout the winter season and beyond. ",4
3," Yorktown, Virginia, where George Washington's decisive victory won American independence from the British, is the scene of the latest skirmish over property and farming rights. Eighty neighborhoods historically zoned agriculturally are being reviewed for rezoning at the behest of a small group of residents who don't approve of a couple of home-based oyster farms. On Wednesday, May 14, over 100 property rights and local foods activists staged a Pitchfork Protest at the York County Planning Commission. Greg Garrett and Anthony Bavuso are the two oyster farm owners whose livelihoods are threatened by the controversy. Both are now members of the Farm-to-Consumer Legal Defense Fund (FTCLDF), which is working to support the two farms and defend their rights. The FTCLDF's mission is to preserve access to locally produced, nutrient-dense foods. Both Garrett and Bavuso, and some of their nearest neighbors, claim that their small-scale farms have a minimal impact on the neighborhood. They also contend that the oysters are cleaning the bay and are thus an ecological plus for the community. Oysters contain powerful nutrition; they are full of vitamins A, B, C and D, protein and zinc. Zinc is an important mineral found most abundantly in oysters. Nutrition scientist Chris Masterjohn said, 'Vitamins A, D, and K2 interact synergistically to support immune health, provide for adequate growth, support strong bones and teeth, and protect soft tissues from calcification. ... [V]itamins A and D can only fulfill their functions in the presence of adequate zinc.' Interestingly, the neighbors most interested in having these oysters as a regular part of their diet are strong supporters of Bavuso and Garrett. At the Planning Commission meeting, 23 people testified in support of the farms and against the county officials' attempt to prohibit them; 16 testified against the farms and in favor of the proposed zoning change. 'This is the first of several meetings, and we feel confident that more people who would be negatively affected by rezoning will come out and express their opposition,' said Garrett. As home-based businesses and home churches become more popular, zoning officials are increasingly using the tool of special-use permits to appease the not-in-my-neighborhood crowd. A recent article in USA Today described the use of special-use permits to give neighbors a chance to hold sway over the use of homes in their neighborhood as short-term vacation rentals. And Virginia's most populous county is currently considering rules to restrict gatherings in private homes. Virginia is a Right-to-Farm state with laws on the books which prevent cities and counties from requiring special-use permits in agricultural districts. The state legislature recently sided by overwhelming margins with the oyster farms of York County by clarifying the law to include aquaculture. The revised law goes into effect January 1, 2015. That hasn't deterred the county officials. The downzoning of York County to residential use only would mean that the oyster farms would have to go.

3," A newly issued report by a U.S. senator found that more than 1,000 U.S. veterans likely died in the past decade because of malpractice in regard to a lack of proper and timely care from the Department of Veterans Affairs' (VA) medical centers. The report from Sen. Tom Coburn, R-Okla., himself a physician, 'aggregates government investigations and media reports to trace a history of fraudulent scheduling practices, budget mismanagement, insufficient oversight and lack of accountability that have led to the current controversy plaguing the VA,' CNN reported. CNN was the first to break the story that some U.S. military veterans had died after being placed on a 'secret waiting list' at the VA medical center in Phoenix. Poor management is costing billions The VA has since admitted that 23 patients died awaiting care that was delayed months, but Coburn's report titled 'Friendly Fire: Death, Delay and Dismay at the VA' reveals that many more deaths have been linked to system-wide failures at VA hospitals and clinics all over the country. Coburn stated that if the VA's budget had been handled properly and the correct management put in place, many of those deaths could have been avoided. 'Over the past decade, more than 1,000 veterans may have died as a result of VA malfeasance,' Coburn, who has survived three bouts with cancer, said. He believes the government should offer veterans access to private-sector hospitals and clinics. 'Poor management is costing the department billions of dollars more and compromising veterans' access to medical care,' he said. Malpractice suits, office remodeling, bonuses Coburn's office said that the VA has allocated some $20 billion since the beginning of the Iraq and Afghanistan wars to a number of non-health-related projects, such as office remodels, unused software licenses, undocumented government debit card purchases, the funding of call centers that received just 2.4 calls per day on average and bonuses for top officials, including administrators of the facilities where vets died waiting for care. As CNN reported: 'In 2013, four VA construction projects in Las Vegas, Orlando, Denver and New Orleans cost an extra $1.5 billion because of scheduling delays and excessive expenditures, the report shows. 'Additional funds have been funneled into legal settlements. Since 2001, the VA has paid about $845 million in malpractice costs, of which $36.4 million was used to settle claims involving delayed health care.' Additional scrutiny has been applied to the VA's budget following revelations about the controversial bonus system payments; they allegedly created incentives for administrators and managers to hide the fact that patients had to wait months for care. At a recent congressional hearing, VA Assistant Secretary for Human Resources and Administration Gina Farrisee confirmed that 78% of senior VA managers qualified for extra pay or other compensation in fiscal year 2013 (fiscal years run from Oct. 1 - Sept. 30), despite the malpractice and treatment delay controversies. Here's one of the more egregious examples: 'Former VA Regional Director Michael Moreland received a $63,000 bonus in 2013 for infection prevention policies, for example, but the VA's Office of Inspector General concluded that his policies failed. Moreland presided over the Pittsburgh VA, where an outbreak of Legionnaires' disease killed six veterans in 2011 and 2012.' In addition, Coburn's report identified crimes that had been committed by VA staff, such as drug dealing, theft and sexual abuse of patients. The incidents spanned the past several years. The requirements are so low Acting VA Secretary Sloan Gibson said in a news conference in Washington in mid-June that he will be removing more VA officials from their positions after he receives more information from the VA Inspector General's Office. However, it's clear the VA's problems are much more systemic and, honestly, successive congresses and White House administrations share the blame. The VA system is like all government-run systems and agencies : There have always been too few resources allocated for the function the agency was created to perform; the incentive to cheat is strong (bonuses in amounts that surpass what 85% of Americans earn in a year); too little real oversight; and an institutionalized bureaucracy that is more concerned about self-preservation than anything else. Some names and positions might change, but the real answer -- getting government out of the healthcare business altogether -- won't. Coburn -- who said he wasn't surprised by his report -- knows; he was trained in a VA hospital. 'The culture in the VA should be people working for veterans, not for the VA, [but] the culture right now is that I work for a system ... and the requirements are so low,' he told Politico . ",4
3," From happy childish squeals of delight during a snow storm to a cozy winter corner wrapped in the seductive lusciousness of sweet warmth, nothing touches the heart or belly like a cup of delicious hot chocolate. The food of the gods , according to ancient Mayans has recently taken center stage on the medical scene because of its amazing healing properties; making sacred chocolate one of the best loved, and most devoured superfoods on the planet. And because earth is the only place you can get chocolate, you may as well stay healthy and stick around to drink more. Health benefits If you're addicted to chocolate, it's because your body knows a good thing. The healthy benefits from chocolate are derived from high levels of antioxidants that increase nitric oxide levels in the blood vessels, enhancing circulation. Additionally, chocolate reduces blood pressure, heart disease and stroke, protects the retina, enhances moods, stops coughing, increases blood flow to the brain, prevents diabetes and protects skin against UV damage. Bet you never knew eating chocolate and vegetables were both good for you when you were a kid. Unsweetened cocoa or Dutch processed? Natural, unsweetened and Dutch processed cocoa are both tangy, and vaguely bitter tasting; however, natural cocoa is slightly acidic. The acidity helps balance the body's pH and retain the full impact of its health benefits. Dutch processed cocoa is treated with an alkalizing agent to smooth the taste; removing the acidity. The process destroys many of the flavanols, reducing its superfood powers. The heavenly elixir Originally, ancient Olmecs and Mayans made hot chocolate by mixing ground cocoa beans with water, wine and chile pepper. Over time, sugar and milk became common additions. Today, nations around the world have their special hot chocolate mixes and you can take advantage of some of them for treating various health conditions. Consider adding a pinch of cayenne pepper to help clear chest congestion or an upset stomach. A small piece of raw or candied ginger improves blood flow and circulation, calming nausea. A dash of red wine helps the heart. Antitussive properties of honey relieve a cough. Adding cinnamon and replacing sweetening with stevia helps control blood sugar. A sprig of mint or basil relieves a case of acid reflux. Vegan or not - The recipe There are as many hot chocolate recipes as there are hot chocolate aficionados. Adjust as you like for quantity and richness. This is a wonderful recipe for vegans or for those who prefer real cream. Makes one serving. In a 14-16 oz. mug add two well-rounded teaspoons of cocoa powder, preferably a premium, unsweetened organic chocolate . Heat 12 oz. coconut milk. Remove from the heat just before it starts boiling and pour a very small amount into the cup, stirring with a spoon or whisk until the cocoa melts. Add the rest of the coconut milk, leaving room for additional cream. Add a pinch of sea salt to the steaming mug, one cinnamon stick, about half a teaspoon of vanilla extract or a pinch of raw vanilla powder, stevia to taste, and organic or raw heavy cream, plain or whipped. Coconut whipped cream may be substituted and is easy to make from a chilled can of coconut cream. Or add marshmallows, nutmeg, or a tiny pinch of cayenne. For a richer chocolate taste, substitute bittersweet, Mexican or white chocolate for the cocoa powder. Between one and a half to two ounces of chocolate makes a comparable cup of chocolat chaud. Check the links below for various international hot chocolate recipes such as Belgian, French, Aztec, Mexican, Italian and Jamaican. Each provides its own distinctive twist.

3," Do you remember our recent story ( http://www.selfnews.com ) about Coca-Cola getting away with advertising one of its drinks as 'Pomegranate Blueberry,' even though it only contained a measly 0.3 percent and 0.2 percent, respectively, of each of those juices? Well, we now learn that the federal government not only sanctions lying about ingredients in drinks, but will punish companies who try to tell the truth about those same products. To recap: Beverage company Pom Wonderful which, as its name suggests, manufactures drinks containing lots of pomegranate, lost a federal false advertising suit it launched against Coca-Cola's subsidiary, Minute Maid, which manufactures the aforementioned Pomegranate Blueberry, because while the ingredients are prominently displayed on the labeling, there is very little of them actually in the drink. But a federal appeals panel, citing federal Food and Drug Administration (FDA) rules, disagreed with Pom Wonderful. A three-judge panel of the 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in San Francisco ruled that said federal regulations say a company can name a drink after a 'flavoring' that it contains, even if it's not the primary ingredient. What makes the ruling even more incredulous, given the second part of this story, is the fact that Minute Maid's label on Pomegranate Blueberry says, 'Help Nourish Your Brain' above a drawing of fruits. That, as you may have deduced, suggests a medical benefit from drinking this pomegranate concoction, even if there isn't much actual pomegranate in it. What's 'deceptive' about the truth? Enter Pom Wonderful, the company that actually puts pomegranate - which research proves can lower harmful LDL cholesterol levels, improve blood flow to the heart for cardiac patients, reduce thickening of arteries that supply blood to the brain, and lower blood pressure - in its drinks. It seems the same federal court system thinks it's okay for Coca-Cola to sprinkle a little of the juice in its drinks and call it nourishment for your brain , but Pom Wonderful - whose drinks contain 100 percent pomegranate juice - can't tout the fruit's health benefits. Just days after the 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals shot down Pom's lawsuit against Coca-Cola, a Federal Trade Commission (FTC) judge ruled that health claims made by Pom were deceptive. The ruling from Administrate Law Judge D. Michael Chappell came after hearing testimony for months, from May through November 2011 - testimony which included appearances by noted diet and coronary expert Dr. Dean Ornish, who - among other foods - recommends eating pomegranates to improve cardiac health. Note, too, that Pom Wonderful, a Delaware company which is headquartered in Los Angeles, has spent some $35 million over the past 10 years studying the health benefits of pomegranates, and relied on the results of that body of research in advertising its products. Not officially sanctioned research Chappell, however, said Pom's advertising 'would lead reasonable consumers to conclude that drinking Pom's juice or taking its supplements would treat, prevent, or reduce serious health problems, and that it was clinically proven to do so,' according to Courthouse News Service . What's more, Chappell said in his 330-page ruling that while Pom's research indeed showed a general health benefit in consuming pomegranate, 'the weight of the persuasive expert testimony demonstrates that there was insufficient competent and reliable scientific evidence to support' the company's specific claims. Huh? Well, all of this is much easier to understand if you look at it from this perspective. It's all about the Leviathan telling you what is, and is not, 'healthy,' and what you can, and cannot say, about legitimate research if it is not conducted or sanctioned by the high-and-mighty in D.C. Pom Wonderful spent tens of millions on research that proves consuming its pomegranate beverages improves overall health. But because the federal government didn't make this discovery, then it's not legitimate and, therefore, inadmissible. Now do these conflicting rulings make sense? For the record, pomegranate is quickly gaining favor in health circles for its nutritional value as an antioxidant-rich fruit. It's health benefits are well-documented now, even if you don't read about them in some government agency's literature. You might say a company that does its own research is tainting the results, but on the other hand, if the same company is later found to have falsified data, what implications would that discovery have for a business that wants to stay around for the long haul?

3," Tweet (NewsTarget) The foundation of a healthy, bountiful garden is its soil. Most any ground can become a good garden with the right care and maintenance. There`s no need to buy a bunch of potting or garden soil from the store either. The best soil is that which you build yourself, naturally. It`s easier to do than you might think too. Once you`ve chosen a location for your garden, you`ll need to analyze the soil to see what it needs to flourish. Using a shovel, dig down about a foot or so so you can see a cross-section of the soil you`re working with. Somewhere between three inches and about a foot, you`ll see a clear change in the soil`s composition. The darker, richer upper portion is topsoil while the next layer is subsoil. Both are vitally important to healthy plants. Especially that subsoil. That lower layer is what decides not only how rich the topsoil layer is, but also how well it performs soaking up and imparting nutrients. If the subsoil is a rich reddish or brown color and easily crumbles in your fingers like cookie dough, it is good ground and needs no help from you to start growing a great garden. Of course, if this is the first time you`ve worked this soil as a garden, you`ll want to make sure it`s loose to encourage easy rooting. If you can`t easily push your finger into the soil down to the last knuckle, then it should be loosened. This can be done with a short tine till. You want to go down about three inches to unpack the topsoil and loosen it up. With proper soil maintenance, you`ll never have to do this again. Unhealthy signs for subsoil include bluish or gray coloration. This is an indication of poor drainage, which stops nutrients and water from flowing freely through the topsoil and into the subsoil. This water tends to stagnate and rob the topsoil of its nutrition while choking the roots of the plants above. Look for the existing plants` roots and see if they all stop in a relatively even line. That is the beginning of the blockage - probably a clay barrier. If the subsoil is thick, hard to work with your fingers, and clumps in heavy balls when squeezed in your hand, it has too much clay and is causing your drainage issues. To fix this problem, you`ll need to add sand to the soil and do some heavy tilling. Till down at least three inches into that subsoil and churn in sand. Start with a light layer of sand on top of the soil, working it in. Continue to add sand as needed until the subsoil has a cookie dough consistency (as above). While you`re tilling, adding extra nutrients like good manure and compost won`t hurt either. Although this soil remediation is extremely invasive, it is necessary to assure proper drainage. If done right, and with proper maintenance, you`ll never need to do it again. Another common problem is a lack of topsoil. If you dig down and see no clear strata line between topsoil and subsoil within 18 inches of the ground level, you likely have under-developed soil. This usually happens because the topsoil was recently scraped or washed away (common with construction) or a large tree or heavy bush was over the soil, blocking sunlight and impeding the microbes that break down nutrients in the soil. Adding manure, compost, etc. and tilling well will fix the problem. However you build your garden`s healthy base, do so with care and an eye for natural sources. In the next part of this series, we`ll discuss garden soil maintenance, sourcing good compost and manure, and building beautiful garden soil year after year in a sustainable, natural way.

4,"NEW YORK - These days, conservatives proudly proclaim their love for the Constitution. Yet many seem unsure whether to revere it or repeal it, plank by plank. Such constitutional nihilism extends well beyond the drive to strike down the health-care law, a jarring move by those long opposed to judicial activism. It reflects a deep discomfort with the country's growth toward a thriving, coast- to-coast democracy. To be sure, these activists insist they only want to show they revere our founding document. Earlier in the year, 80 groups issued the 'Mount Vernon Statement.' 'The federal government today ignores the limits of the Constitution, which is increasingly dismissed as obsolete and irrelevant,' it said. Rep. Michele Bachmann, a Republican from Minnesota and head of the Tea Party Caucus in Congress, recently said she would start another caucus, for 'Constitutional Conservatives.' One expects them to show up on C-SPAN in powdered wigs. But as for the actual Constitution, as we have lived it for two centuries, some are itching to pull out their quill pens and start furiously crossing things out. Some advocates want to rewrite the 14th Amendment, a landmark of the Constitution -- indeed, of human freedom. The amendment guaranteed equal protection of the law and due process to former slaves. Under its provisions, if you were born in the United States you had the rights of a citizen. The amendment was enacted by the Radical Republicans, which meant something very different back in 1868. Now Sens. John Kyl, R-Ariz., and Lindsey Graham, R-S.C., have suggested rewriting this core part of the national charter. Children born here are not in fact citizens, they argue, if their parents crossed the border illegally. In addition to punishing innocents for what their parents have done, this would rewrite a central provision of the Constitution for the sake of a temporary solution to a barely existent problem. To punish a few 'anchor babies,' they would redo the handiwork of the great Civil War amendments. Other conservatives decry the 16th Amendment, which authorized the income tax. Until Glenn Beck floated the idea of its repeal last year, it was known mostly to high school students studying for an SAT subject test. After a Gilded Age Supreme Court declared it unconstitutional to tax income from property and other sources, it proved necessary to enact a constitutional change to fund the federal government. This was a breakthrough in the drive for a strong country. As Supreme Court Justice Oliver Wendell Holmes said at the time, 'Taxes are the price we pay for civilization.' Most baffling of all, many Tea Party backers want to overturn the 17th Amendment, which created direct public election of U.S. senators in 1912. This was a key political reform of the Progressive Era, and a major step forward for democracy. Those who want to end direct election of senators say the step would return power to the states. Certainly, it would give state legislators more power -- and the lobbyists and party bosses who make governing such a treat in so many capitols. The thought of Albany or Sacramento choosing senators doesn't exactly inspire confidence. Lobbyist power would make us pine for the good old days of earmarks. More fundamental, why would voters want to give away the power to choose their own representatives? The original tea party called for 'no taxation without representation.' This tea party seems to pine for 'taxation with no representation.' As they target past amendments, self-designated constitutional conservatives have one of their own. Rep. Eric Cantor, a Virginia Republican in line to become House majority leader next month, is among the backers of a so-called Repeal Amendment, which would give two-thirds of the states the power to nullify federal laws. This amendment, if passed, would mark the dismantling of the strong national government that has helped make the U.S. the most powerful nation in world history. It would turn back the clock not to before the New Deal, but to before the Civil War. Strikingly, these constitutional forays would repeal some of the greatest advances in democracy. A movement born as a populist squall seems oddly uncomfortable with the very mechanisms that give ordinary citizens the loudest voice. It is genuinely heartening that people care about the Constitution. The rhetoric, at least, denotes a craving for a meaningful national identity, a yearning for core values that we should all applaud. But may I suggest to our overheated fellow Americans: Don't stop at reading the Constitution. Try the Declaration of Independence too: 'All men are created equal.' Michael Waldman, former head speechwriter for President Bill Clinton, is executive director of the Brennan Center for Justice at New York University School of Law and the author of 'My Fellow Americans.'

4,"The lawyer for a sports doctor who has treated Tiger Woods says the superstar golfer is in no way linked to the drug-related conspiracy charges Dr. Anthony Galea faces. Galea, 51, is facing four charges related to the unapproved drug known as Actovegin. He has been charged with conspiracy to import an unapproved drug, conspiracy to export a drug and smuggling goods into Canada. His lawyer, Brian Greenspan, said Friday that those charges are in no way related to Woods. Greenspan says Actovegin is used worldwide and there was nothing unlawful about Galea's use of the substance. Actovegin, which contains calf blood, has stirred up controversy over its efficacy and legality. It's not on the list of banned substances for the World Anti-Doping Agency, unless it's used by intravenous infusion. ",3
4,"Imagine yourself in the atrium lobby of a hotel with soaring wood-beamed ceilings, a massive stone fireplace and a bar tucked off just to the side. Then imagine rooms that, at 500 square feet, are bigger than some New York City apartments, with fireplaces, seating areas, fridges and microwaves. Move on to the hotel spa, complete with hot stone massages, green facials and soothing music. Next, hit the hot tub that, at 381 square feet, is virtually guaranteed to be the largest you've ever soaked your troubles away in. Where is this perfect haven for a grown-up getaway? Great Wolf Lodge. No, you didn't misread, and I didn't mistype. That indoor water park behemoth outside Williamsburg, whose name is so often uttered with the world-weary sigh of parents who are 'doing it for the kids,' has a lot to offer adults - with and without offspring. Let's face it, the 12-resort chain bills itself as 'family friendly.' That means kids roaming the hallways, waving wands at dragons as they complete tasks on 'MagiQuest,' a Harry Potter-esque interactive adventure. And while many of the littler darlings have Mom or Dad in tow, what's remarkable is the number of tweens and teens, traveling in groups sans adults, who are on the prowl - in the hallways, at the water park, in the arcade or the video-game room. Great Wolf spokeswoman Angie Amberg says the majority of the kids who come to the park are between ages 4 and 12, but with an arcade full of games including Fast and Furious, Terminator Salvation, Superbikes and Dance Dance Revolution, it would be easy to characterize the place as 12-year-old nirvana. All of which means that the parents of these kids can take a seat around the ample bar - and on a recent Saturday night, that's where more than a dozen were. Or they can share a glass of wine at a table overlooking the water park. Or just stay in their room, in front of the fire - with a good book, of course. Great Wolf offers kids the opportunity for a little independence and parents the assurance that they're risking little by giving the kids that independence. 'It just feels very safe and contained,' said Jennifer Foster, who had brought her 14-year-old son and a friend. 'I feel comfortable letting them go off by themselves.' Adding to that sense of security is the fact that, unlike some other resorts, Great Wolf allows only hotel guests to use the water park. It offers the sense - not unlike a cruise ship - of being part of a self-contained society. But Great Wolf also proves itself as a destination for those who want to embrace their inner child, even without children of their own. A group of five 40-something women chatting away in the cavernous adults-only hot tub during a recent weekend giddily share their secret. 'We're here on a girls' weekend to celebrate our friend who is becoming a first-time bride in February,' says Janet Yandle, a teacher from Chester, Va. She points over at the not-quite-blushing bride, Pam Klein, who describes the place as 'awesome' as she dangles her feet in 100-plus degree water. So what's the appeal for this group of four teachers and a nurse? 'It's nice to have kids nearby without having to yell at them,' Yandle says quickly, before adding: 'It feels like you've really gotten away from everything.' Fellow teacher Sue Brown is a repeat Great Wolf Lodger. 'I've been to a lot of spas, and the one here is as nice as any,' she says. 'It's as peaceful in there as it is wild out here.' And she points to the massive, always 84-degree complex that is home to a wave pool, a dumping bucket, a lazy river and slides of varying thrill levels. 'We ought to be ashamed of ourselves,' she laughs, before mentioning that she can't wait to ride the Howling Tornado, the six-story-high funnel ride that is the resort's signature destination for the over 48-inch set. The lines for the Tornado, River Canyon Run and some of the other more extreme slides are dominated by the tween and teen crowd. Sure, there's the occasional dad or mom pretending to chaperone offspring but really there only to relive the glee that inevitably accompanies a rubber tube, an unexpected stomach-lurching drop and the spray of cold water in the face. But just as easily, Mom can opt to grab an inner tube and be gently tossed in the wave pool while teenage sons make their way up the four-story Fort McKenzie to find the perfect perch from which to dump buckets of water on unsuspecting - but delighted - guests below. All this comes at a price: Rooms and suites range from about $200 to more than $400 a night (though that includes water park admission). So the question becomes: What price to put on a getaway weekend that elicits squeals of joy from the kids and ahhs of relaxation from the adults? In a word: priceless. ",1

4,"NEW YORK - The Met finally got one right. And it was a tough one. It takes a bunch of really good singers to bring off Verdi's 'Don Carlo,' with voices loud enough to drown out the drone of us opera-lovers mourning the decline of Verdi- singing in the modern age. Admittedly, not all of the singers at the 'Don Carlo' premiere on Monday night were actually able to change our minds. But there was enough solid singing, and Nicholas Hytner's production -- his first at the Met -- was good enough to make a satisfying evening of opera. Or maybe I just love 'Don Carlo' so much that I'm willing to be optimistic about the proverbial half- full glass. Hytner adopted what I suspect is becoming a formula for European directors approaching the Metropolitan Opera: the 'put them in traditional costumes and create slightly stylized sets' plan of attack. (Luc Bondy is still fine-tuning that one.) The sets, by Bob Crowley (also in a Met debut), ranged from servicable to evocative, starting with stylized white trees in the snowscape of Fontainebleau (where the opera's five-act version opens) and extending to a dark space shot through with shafts of smoky light, the vault of the monastery of St. Just, dramatically awe-full. A forbidding wall pierced with small square windows descended between scenes, repeatedly shutting Carlo out of the spaces where the action played. Some of the stylization was a little trite (the female chorus sported big fur cuffs in the Fontainebleau scene, bright red fans in the red- and-black garden scene), and King Philip's cavernous study seemed like a half- finished idea, but the general idiom of big dark spaces, large columns, military severity was effective. The real reason it worked, though, was Hytner's attention to the characters. It's always hard to know how much inspiration comes from a director and how much from the singer: Ferruccio Furlanetto, who has become one of the great portrayers of King Philip and whose 'Ella giammai m'amo' monologue at the opening of Act IV was stunning, had some of the same tender, telling touches on Monday that he showed in live broadcast of La Scala's opening night in 2008. After accusing his wife, Elisabetta, of adultery, he grabs her fainted body and cradles her head, pouring out all the affection he can't figure out how to give her when she's conscious. But Hytner certainly had a hand in it. And his conception of Elisabetta was one of the best things in the opera. The future Queen burst onto the scene at the very start of the opera, a strong-willed, loose-haired tomboy princess with a hunting rifle, beautiful and proud and free. She met Carlo, fell wildly in love, and then learned she had been betrothed to his father; you could see the walls of duty closing in around her as for the first time in her life she couldn't do exactly what she wanted. Marina Poplavskaya embodied this free spirit, and her subsequent proud sad life at the Spanish court, so convincingly, and sang with such a lovely tone -- round and supple and warm -- that you could sometimes overlook the fact that the part was clearly two sizes too big for her. She couldn't fake this in the big passages, though she tried to temper her delivery of the big final aria, 'Tu che le vanita,' with artistry and sophisticated pianos. I hate to keep harping on a theme in my writing about the Met, but the company here yet again has chosen a voice that's too small for the role, but that I predict will sound great in the HD broadcast (scheduled for December 11). Vocally, the evening was sustained by Furlanetto and Roberto Alagna, who as Don Carlo sounded ragged in his opening aria but quickly sang his way into a firmer, ringing delivery -- a little tinny at times, and a little rough at others, but overall thoroughly respectable. Simon Keenlyside's Posa was more a work in progress. Here's another singer who doesn't quite have the vocal heft for the role, though he came to it with both beauty and artistry. (Posa's love for Carlo in this production extended beyond mere battlefield camaraderie.) Keenlyside overcompensated for vocal lightness with a kind of physical restlessness that's become widespread among many of the Met's so-called 'singing actors.' There's been a lot of criticism of the old-school approach of 'park and bark' around the Met in the last few years, but the ability to keep still on stage conveys a kind of authority and strength that lots of gestures seldom achieve -- as Furlanetto's King Philip abundantly demonstrated in his magisterial Act II duet with Keenlyside's shifting Posa.

4,"Problem: Organizing kids' papers actually has two parts. First, parents must create order for dealing with permission slips and information a child brings home for them to read and sign. A parent should also set up a system for preserving report cards, artwork, school pictures and other paper that filters through children's lives, and maintain a family calendar. Second, parents must teach children how to maintain order for themselves. They need to learn how to have a place for everything in their bedroom, desk and backpack. Household routines keep a family running smoothly. Expert: Sandra Forbes, a professional organizer and mother of seven in suburban Washington. Her firm, Forbes Organizing, advises working moms and develops home management techniques. The fix: Forbes said kids need different guidance during three stages of their education. In elementary school, the challenge for children is bringing paper home and bringing paper back to school. In middle school, organizing all the supplies and books they need for every class becomes vital. In high school, the issue is time management. At each stage, a parent needs to work with their child in developing systems that help everyone get out the door on time in the morning and into bed at a decent hour. Some kids need a checklist on the front door of what they need to bring to school every day, from lunch money to band instruments. Some families load backpacks at night and set them by the door or other 'launch pad' before bedtime. Creating a designated home study area is essential. 'They should have all the supplies they need to do their work,' she says. 'Then they don't get up to get something and get distracted.' Keeping a family binder in your kitchen or on your desk gives a home to all the essential paper that's constantly arriving from teachers, band leaders and coaches. Forbes uses a three-ring binder with tabs for each child. Using clear sleeves, Forbes organized schedules, phone lists and academic and sports calendars. You can use a similar binder for report cards and awards. She purges unneeded papers at the end of the school year and starts over. 'Piled-up paper is a lack of making decisions,' she said. 'You want to avoid that.' Tips 1. Keep a bright-colored file labeled 'pending' for permission slips and any other paperwork that is due sometime in the future. It prevents last-minute panic. 2. Forbes uses the Microsoft Outlook calendar as a master clearinghouse for family dates. She clicks and drags e-mails into her calendar so all the information she needs on an activity is in the same place. 3. A weekly cleaning by each child of his own bedroom floor can turn up missing items and keep the room orderly so kids can focus on studying. Clean out backpacks, where children tend to stuff old papers and food wrappers in there. This weekly ritual often turns up missing library books, too, she said. ",1
4,"If our goal is carbon reduction, a cap-and-trade or carbon-pricing bill, with its likely compromises, would be worse right now than no regulation. Pricing carbon below $40 per ton will not change how industry does business or drive adoption of new technologies. With legislation unlikely to support such prices, uncertainty is better than a low price that disincentivizes the development of technologies that have radically less carbon. Much as Craig Venter used tools for genome sequencing to outrace the larger, longer and costlier government-sponsored human genome project, it makes more sense to focus over the next five years on the development of carbon-reduction technologies rather than on maximizing short-term emissions reduction. Cherry- picking reductions of 5 to 10 percent through low-hanging efficiency upgrades could distract from developing technologies that reduce emissions 80 percent. By focusing instead on the large wedges that account for 75 percent of carbon emissions _ electricity and transportation _ we could achieve the lion's share of our goals with a small fraction of the complexity. If we develop low-cost, high-efficiency technologies upfront, we can spark a wave of adoption and create companies and jobs _ the Googles of the energy sector. Innovation is America's natural advantage, one whose fruits we can export worldwide as other countries seek to adopt cost-effective technologies. Well-designed legislation to reduce carbon emissions in electricity and petroleum could enable the development of substantially better alternative technologies for 70 percent of our carbon emissions, reducing our largest energy security risks. Consider: Sen. Jeff Bingaman, D-N.M., has proposed requiring electricity providers to use a minimum percentage of energy from renewable sources. If this standard were modified to allow low-carbon electricity from any source, not just renewable, with carbon emissions that are 80 percent lower than coal, it could get support from nuclear, natural gas and even coal advocates. Opening the playing field like this would increase competition and drive down prices. This would encourage coal with sequestration and nuclear technologies to accelerate development to compete. Bipartisan support for such standards is possible because this proposal is not dramatically different from ones by Bingaman, as well as by Sens. Lamar Alexander, R-Tenn., Jim Webb, D-Va., and Richard Lugar, R-Ind. If the proposal passed, we would achieve a technology-neutral, market-based win for climate legislation by reducing emissions from our largest source of carbon. The United States could aim to get 20 to 25 percent of our electricity from sources that use 80 percent less carbon than benchmark coal by 2020, which would meet or exceed the standard set by the House bill passed last June. For utilities, it would reduce uncertainty and encourage investment. Importantly, a low-carbon electricity standard would be superior to a utilities cap. A cap can easily be met in the next 10 years by incremental adjustments to existing assets (such as repowering coal power plants with natural gas and shutting the most inefficient plants). In contrast, a low-carbon electricity standard can be met only by the rapid development of radically low-carbon technology; these technologies can then be exported to India and China, which deploy much of the coal-fired electricity. Such a standard would build low carbon capacity the fastest and give the United States a competitive advantage in the emerging low-carbon economy. The renewable-fuels standard could likewise be modified to a more technology- neutral low-carbon fuels standard, which would reduce concerns about the impact on the food supply, such as corn vs. ethanol, through diversification. Adopting this standard, as California has, would increase energy security and reduce oil risk _ no small feat in light of the threats posed by oil spills and petro- dictators such as Venezuela's Hugo Ch vez or Iran's Mahmoud Ahmadinejad. Meanwhile, regulating cars in technology-neutral effective grams of carbon emitted per mile, instead of miles per gallon, would allow more efficient engines to compete with electric cars. And compete they should, as some engine technologies may deliver more carbon savings at a fraction of the cost of electric vehicles and hybrids. Furthermore, producing non-food biofuels could be the largest source of new jobs and gross domestic product growth in rural America. Efficiency is another big lever. Why not set up a 'fee-bate system' in which rebates go to those who purchase items that are among the most energy-efficient, be they refrigerators, cars or lighting, while the most inefficient pay fees to fund the rebates? Efficiency standards could update automatically every few years based on the top-tier performers, whose economics and consumer acceptance have been demonstrated. Most important, Washington must stop 'picking winners.' Tax credits and loan guarantees should be equally available to all low-carbon technologies, be they carbon capture and storage, solar, wind or nuclear. Focus on electric cars and hybrids has already decreased investor interest in more-efficient engines. 'Natural gas' trucks are an example of Washington favoring technologies when better paths exist. Why force 'repowering' of coal plants with natural gas when one can be technology-neutral, specifying a certain amount of carbon per megawatt hour, or prefer electric hybrids over more cost-effective and efficient hydraulic hybrids? Between cleaner electricity and transportation, we can start addressing 75 percent of our sources of carbon emissions, while efficiency improvements will reduce emissions in the remaining 25 percent. In the meantime, we can increase energy security and create competitive American companies and sustainable jobs. Climate change may be uncertain to some, but if we take steps to ensure against nuclear attacks, the disruption of oil supplies and acts of terrorism, why not ensure against climate risk? Such actions would increase competition and decrease long-term energy costs. - - - Khosla is founder of the venture capital firm Khosla Ventures, which has interests in several aspects of clean technology, including solar, wind, batteries, carbon sequestration, nuclear, geothermal and biofuels, as well as in energy-efficiency technologies such as engines, electric motors, lighting, air conditioning and the smart grid.

4,"The top Senate Democrat says he will force a test vote this week on a measure to give tens of thousands of young illegal immigrants a path to legal status. Sen. Harry Reid of Nevada says he will move to schedule action on the so-called Dream Act. It would give more than 100,000 young immigrants brought to the United States before the age of 16 chances to become legal residents if they attend college or join the military. It was unclear whether Reid could muster the 60 votes necessary to move to an up-or-down vote on the measure. It has some degree of bipartisan support, but is opposed by most Republicans and some Democrats who regard it as little more than an amnesty grant for illegal immigrants. ",2
4,"I write this from a hotel room near my home town. We had to escape. Two weeks with both sides of our family has sent us into hiding, and I will not disclose our location. The holiday traditions that sounded so lovely and warm in November are long gone now. A Snow Cat rolled over them somewhere between the eggnog and the yule log. As we packed the car, we vowed that next year we will take this delicious expanse of two weeks with our children and do something extraordinary _ a getaway with just the two kids, when we can be our little family without the pressures of dueling traditions. We agreed on our New Year's resolution. In the rearview mirror, we saw the detritus of my traditional Christmas dinner, killed by the in-laws' preference for a restaurant. The leisurely brunch we wanted to have on New Year's Day at a restaurant was quashed by my parents' second round of sledding and heart-healthy oatmeal. His family drives three blocks to dinner; mine cross-country skis there. In the kitchens, we skirmished over dishwasher-loading techniques, knife sharpening, coffee grinding, the best way to put sweetener in coffee, how long to cook a steak and the stacking of Tupperware. On Christmas, I declared my savior to be the merry margarita, and plenty of Facebook friends agreed. They were exasperated by their families, too. There was the heated argument over health-care reform, the remote-control tug of war between Fox News and CNN, the epic argument over when to use the four-wheel drive and, of course, a debate about whether vampires are cooler than werewolves. When my husband's family planned its annual dive into the frightening waters of the shopping mall in December, I shuddered in fear and went to work instead. When my family clicked into our skis for a nighttime schuss at 8,200 feet on New Year's Eve, my husband declared us all insane and retreated to the ski lodge. And to think that I always wondered why anyone would want to vacation away from extended family over the winter break. Mai tais instead of mulled wine? Grand Bahama instead of grandma? But a recent Travelocity poll found that 58 percent of people polled said they would rather go on a real vacation than an obliged, out-of-town visit to family. That kind of getaway is known as an oblication, which is barely one step above a staycation. Or maybe I mean one step down. The past two weeks involved two cross-country flights, 379 timeouts, three crying jags and several declarations of divorce (by several women). I began to think that 58 percent of people in the Travelocity survey are very, very smart. We left my family a day early (before my father discovered we had broken the shower head in his bathroom), found a hotel near the airport and exhaled. I immediately went online to start looking for next year's destination. Later, we had dinner with an old friend of ours, a single mom of a 3-year-old who has lost both of her parents. She joined us for Christmas a couple of years ago, and we still worry that she was overwhelmed by the chaos of it all. 'You know, I was just so lonely this year. I was kind of waiting for an invitation all week,' she told us. 'I just don't have that pull to go anywhere, and sometimes I wish for that.' Last year, my husband and I resolved to spend the holidays away from the family. Of course, we forgot about that pact once autumn came, and we felt that pull. It's probably what will happen again. I think that for December 2010, we'll do one thing differently: extend that invitation to our friend and allow the electricity that three children can generate to light up the holiday. Christmas and chaos, one and the same. E-mail me with your post-holiday woes at dvorakp@washpost.com. ",2
4,"How do you recover from the death of a child? The movie 'Rabbit Hole' eloquently posits the only correct answer to that question: You don't. Based on David Lindsay-Abaire's acclaimed 2006 play of the same name, 'Rabbit Hole' focuses on a grieving couple eight months after their young son was killed by a car while chasing his dog into the street. What on the surface seems to possess all the melodrama and photogenic suffering of a banal prime-time weepie instead becomes a lucid, tough, deeply sensitive examination of emotional fortitude. It's important for viewers to know that it's okay to laugh during 'Rabbit Hole.' Thanks to Lindsay-Abaire's mastery of difficult tonal shifts and John Cameron Mitchell's alert, nimble direction, laughs and tears co-exist, if not comfortably, at least recognizably as equally necessary to surviving life's most devastating moments. In Nicole Kidman and Aaron Eckhart, Mitchell has found actors who gracefully pull off that psychological high-wire act as Becca and Howie, an attractive, prosperous couple who have reached the point in their mourning where most of their friends and neighbors think it's time to be moving on. Howie tries to do this by attending support-group meetings and contemplating another child. Becca cooks compulsively, repels the efforts of friends to get together and goes about daily life with crisp matter-of-factness, even when it comes to removing their son's drawings from the refrigerator. Becca reserves her cruelest barbs for her mother, Nat (Dianne Wiest), who lost a grown son to drug addiction but whose attempts at empathy Becca resents as unearned comparisons. (Sandra Oh and Tammy Blanchard, as a support group member and Becca's sister, respectively, provide welcome comic relief for the film's most discomfiting encounters.) Becca eventually discovers solace in the most surprising place imaginable, but 'Rabbit Hole' resists facile catharsis or easy equivalencies. Thanks in large part to Kidman's refusal to soften her character's most fascinating sharp edges, as well as Mitchell's superb command of the material, 'Rabbit Hole' gives the lie to such comforting fictions as closure and transcendence. As Wiest suggests in her character's moving soliloquy, sometimes the best thing to do with feelings isn't to 'process' or 'work through' them, but simply to feel them. 'Hanging in there' can often seem like a meaningless cliche, but in 'Rabbit Hole' the phrase takes on newfound meaning as perhaps the hardest, most heroic thing in the world to do. PG-13. Contains mature thematic material, drug use and profanity. 92 minutes. ",1
4,"Australian and Ne Zalnd sietitshae se pehstri fater t hlpma the color of giant extinct birds and said Wednesday they believe their method could help reconstruct the appearance of other extinct bird species. The researchers retrieved ancient DNA from four species of New Zealand's extinct Moa from feathers found in caves and rock shelters and believed to be at least 2,500 years old. The native Moa -- a flightless, powerfully built forager that stood over 8 feet (2.50 meters) tall and weighed 550 pounds (250 kilograms) -- ranged widely in southern New Zealand before the arrival of man. Using DNA analysis, scientists from New Zealand's Landcare Research and Australia's Adelaide University reconstructed the mainly plain brown plumage of the stout legged Moa, heavy-footed Moa, upland Moa and South Island giant Moa. 'Some had white-tipped feathers to create a speckled appearance' that they used as camouflage, said researcher Nicolas Rawlence from the university's Australian Center for Ancient DNA. The findings were published Wednesday in the Proceedings of the Royal Society of London. A co-author of the study, Jamie Wood of Landcare Research, said it is likely that the Moa's drab color was to avoid predation by the extinct indigenous Haast's eagle, once the biggest and most powerful eagle in the world. The study notes that the drab camouflage plumage of several other New Zealand native birds, including the flightless Kiwi and flightless nocturnal Kakapo parrot, supports this concept. Moa quickly became extinct after indigenous Maori settled in New Zealand about 1200 A.D. Thereeachshwe i ws osibe o etiee NAfrm ll part o the ancient feathers, not just the tip of the quill as previously thought, Wood said. This important finding opens the way to study DNA from museum birds just by clipping a small part of a single feather, causing almost no damage to the valuable specimens. Ancient DNA center director, Prof. Alan Cooper, said the findings suggest it may be possible to reconstruct the appearance of other extinct birds using feathers from fossil deposits. 'There are so many enigmatic extinct species that it would be great to see 'clothed,'' Cooper said. Alan Tennyson, fossil curator at New Zealand's national museum, called the work 'another step forward to understanding what these extinct birds really looked like ... and their whole interaction with the environment.' Tennyson was not associated with the study. 'We had a vague idea of the color of different Moa species,' he told The Associated Press, 'but this is a breakthrough, actually being able to say these colored feathers came from this species of Moa.'

4,"Now that spring's leafy green canopies are full overhead, it's possible to dine underneath them again. Or you can bring the essence of light, breezy outdoor dining to an indoor table. This project borrows a simple technique from childhood arts-and-crafts camp: using leaves to create single prints. The result offers a rare combination: bold while understated, indoors or out. Leaves that are fresh and pliable work best. Look for ones with raised veins that will transfer to your fabric. You can sew your own place mats, or simply embellish a store-bought set. Or use the technique on a table runner or napkins if you prefer. Experiment on scrap material first to get a sense of how much paint and pressure to use, and to find out which leaves will create the most striking images. You'll need: _ Store-bought or handmade place mats in a natural fabric such as linen or cotton _ Iron and ironing board _ Textile paint _ Foam brush _ Plain paper _ Brayer, rolling pin or tall glass How to: 1. If you're making the place mats, use one yard of linen or cotton to create a set of four. Cut four 14-by-19-inch rectangles, fold each edge a quarter-inch to the back of the fabric, and press. Fold in another quarter-inch, press, and stitch the edges. 2. Wash and dry the place mats; press if necessary. 3. Working on a covered surface, use a foam brush to apply a thin coat of textile paint to the underside of a leaf. 4. Place the leaf paint-side down on a place mat. 5. Lay a piece of scrap paper on top of the leaf to catch excess paint. 6. Roll a brayer, rolling pin or straight glass over the paper, making sure to roll over every part of the leaf. 7. Remove the paper, then carefully pull up the leaf to reveal the image. 8. Repeat for as many place mats as desired. 9. Heat-set the print according to the directions on the textile paint. This ensures that the color is locked into the fabric so the place mats can be washed. Most paints require you to air dry completely, then press each side of the fabric with a hot iron. ",1

4,"Even the nicest and most caring religious people are often unaware of quite how rude they are being. For example, it's extremely impolite to ask me how, if I don't believe in your personal god, I can possibly have any sense of morality. And it's also rather presumptuous, as well as illogical, to suggest that, now that I know of a nasty change in my physical condition, it's surely time for me to be thinking of an alteration in my mental and intellectual state as well. Leaving aside those who have thanked god for giving me cancer and a future in the eternal inferno, the offer of prayer can only have two implications: either a wish for my recovery or a wish for a reconsideration of my atheism (or both). In the first instance, a get-well card - accompanied by a good book or a fine bottle - would be just as bracing if not indeed more so. In the second one, a clear suggestion is present: surely now, at last, Hitchens, your fears will begin to vanquish your reason. What a thing to hope for! Yet without this parody of concern, religion would instantly lose a vast portion of its power. If I was to be wrong about this, then the faithful would have been praying for me to see the light when I was not dying. But this they mostly did not choose to do. The deity whose intercession is being implored is claimed to be omniscient, omnipotent and omnipresent. It is fully aware of the situation. It can make me a believer if it chooses, or wave away my carcinoma. Why should it be swayed by the entreaties of other sinners? My provisional conclusion is that those who practice incantations are doing so as much for their sake as mine: no harm in that to be sure and likely to produce just as much of a result. Writer Christoper Hitchens contributed this to the On Faith blog at www.washingtonpost.com, which is featuring a week long video series with Hitchens about his diagnosis and his beliefs. ",1

4,"Europe's governments are struggling to deal with a mountain of debt made worse by the past three years of global financial and economic turmoil. Here are thumbnail sketches of how some of the countries involved are faring -- and what they're doing to escape the crisis. ITALY: 2009 debt: 115.8 percent of gross domestic product Deficit: 5.3 percent of GDP. 2010 growth estimate: 0.8 percent. 2011 estimate: 1.0 percent. Unemployment: 8.6 percent. Italy has piled up lots of debt but so far has been spared the troubles plaguing Greece. Bond markets are still willing to lend at affordable rates in the belief the country will make good on its debts. Still, rising market pressures on other countries has forced Prime Minister Silvio Berlusconi's government to announce spending cuts to reassure bond investors the country's finances are under control. That surprised Italians after they had been assured for months by Berlusconi and his aides that Italy would escape the government crisis without painful measures. Berlusconi announced (EURO)25 billion ($30 billion) in budget cuts for 2011-2012 to reduce the deficit to 2.7 percent of GDP by 2012. The cuts target the country's bloated bureaucracy and aim to recoup some of the estimated (EURO)120 billion Italy loses to due widespread tax evasion. While welcoming the measures, Italy's main industrial lobby Confindustria said they don't do enough to spur Italy's perennially sluggish growth. ------ GREECE: 2009 debt: 115.1 percent of GDP. Deficit: 13.6 percent. Deficit projection for 2010: 8.1 percent. 2010 growth estimate: minus 4.0 percent. 2011 estimate: minus 2.6. Unemployment: 12.1 percent Europe's problem child, Greece spent itself into trouble with a bloated public sector and widespread tax evasion, then lied about the shape of its finances. In October, a new government shocked markets by announcing the debt was 12.5 percent of GDP, more than four times the previous government's estimate. It has subsequently revised up to 13.6 percent. Revelations that past governments had fudged statistics further undermined market confidence. As a result, bond markets hammered Greek debt and refused to lend to Greece at an affordable rate. Prime Minister George Papandreous's government was forced to take a (EURO)110 billion bailout from the eurozone countries and the International Monetary Fund to avoid defaulting in May. Many economists think Greece will eventually have to restructure its debts despite the bailout because of its weak economic growth. Debt is projected to peak at 149.1 percent of GDP in 2013 before beginning to fall the following year. Greece faces the double challenge of massive debt, which stands at about 310 billion euros, and the harsh austerity measures imposed in order to release the eurozone-IMF rescue loans are expected to dampen consumer spending. With no particular industrial output to speak of, Greece is a heavily consumer-based economy, so the recession will further hamper the government's efforts to pull itself out of its debt crisis. Tourism, one of its main industries, is already suffering after television images of Greeks rioting over austerity plans. ------ BELGIUM: 2009 debt: 96.7 percent of GDP Deficit: 6 percent. 2010 growth estimate: 1.3 percent. 2011 estimate: 1.6 percent. Unemployment rate in March: 8.1 percent. Belgium's reliance on trade has hurt the economy in the last two years ago, but the recent recovery in European exports -- many routed through the busy port of Antwerp -- has helped the economy return to growth. However, the country's persistent budget deficits and uncertainty over political reforms that could transfer more power from the federal government to the regions mean that it may face problems curbing a debt mountain that will top 100 percent in 2011. ------ FRANCE: 2009 debt: 78.1 percent of GDP. Deficit: 7.5 percent of GDP. 2010 growth estimate: 1.4 percent. 2011 estimate: 2.5 percent. Unemployment: 10.1 percent. Five months after unveiling a euro 35 billion 'Big Loan' aimed at spurring France's moribund economy to life, French President Nicolas Sarkozy announced this week that tackling 30 years of accumulated deficits is now a 'national priority.' A three-year spending freeze, combined with a crackdown on tax loopholes and other measures are now promised as a way of bringing France's deficit under the 3 percent threshold enshrined in EU rules by 2013. Of cource, Sarkozy once promised to achieve that by this year, but that was before the crisis. French government forecasts of 2.5 percent growth from 2011 onward are optimistic compared to estimate of only 1.7 percent growth from the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development, a grouping of developed countries. ------ PORTUGAL: 2009 debt: 76.6 percent of GDP Deficit: 9.4 percent of GDP 2010 growth estimate: 0.5 percent 2011 estimate: 0.9. percent Unemployment: 10.5. percent Portugal's economy, burdened by low education levels and labor laws that make hiring and firing difficult, has been struggling to get traction since the turn of the century, with growth averaging less than 1 percent since 2000. Traditional industries such as textiles and footwear have shrunk under global competition while tourism, which generates 10 percent of economic output and jobs, has slumped amid the global economic crisis. The minority center-left Socialist government is trying to develop high-tech sectors such as renewable energy but as a small country of 10.6 million people Portugal is dependent on growth in its European trading partners for an export recovery. It is also trying to increase trade with developing nations, especially Angola, its former colony, and Portuguese-speaking Brazil. The government predicts the national debt it will peak at 90.1 percent of GDP in 2012 before falling back. ------ GERMANY: 2009 debt: 73.2 percent of GDP Deficit: 3.3 percent of GDP 2010 growth estimate: 1.4 percent 2011 estimate: 1.6 percent Unemployment: 8.1 percent Germany, the eurozone's biggest economy, cut its budget deficit to zero in 2008 but then saw it return last year in the wake of the global financial crisis. The government says this year's deficit will be above 5 percent, but it has pledged to get back below 3 percent by 2013. The constitution has a 'debt brake' that forces the government to cut back borrowing over the coming years. Germany's recovery has been heavily reliant on exports, and domestic demand has been a weak point for years. Chancellor Angela Merkel started her second term last October pledging tax relief to boost the economy but her new center-right government delivered only a modest package of measures. Merkel pushed hard to make sure the European Union's bailout of Greece was accompanied by promises of harsh cutbacks, and some accused her of making the crisis worse by delaying. Bailing out Greece was unpopular at home, and Merkel's party suffered a state election defeat in May that deprived her government of a majority in the upper house of parliament. Merkel declared that further tax cuts won't be possible until 2013 and the emphasis will now be on keeping debt under control. She hasn't yet detailed possible spending cuts but has indicated that education will be spared. ------ IRELAND: 2009 debt: 65 percent of GDP. Deficit: 14.3 percent. 2010 growth estimate: minus 0.7 percent. 2011 estimate: 3.0 percent. Unemployment: 12.6 percent. Ireland enjoyed Europe's longest sustained growth from 1994 to 2007 amid unprecedented investment by foreign high-tech firms seeking a low-tax base in the European Union. But the Celtic Tiger boom collapsed amid the global credit crisis, which exposed the country's reckless reliance on foreign lending and property speculation to fuel spending. In its annual budget in December, Ireland slashed pay for state workers, cut welfare benefits and imposed new environmental taxes on fuel as part of a record (EURO)4 billion ($6 billion) in budget cuts to combat the runaway deficit. It was rewarded for the budgetary constraints with far lower market borrowing costs than Greece. The Irish government said recently it is on track to cut its deficit to be in line with the European Union's limit of 3 percent of GDP by 2014. ------ BRITAIN: 2009/10 estimated debt as percentage of GDP: 62 percent. Deficit: 10.4 percent. 2010 growth estimate: 1-1.5 percent. 2011 estimate: 3-3.5 percent. Unemployment: 8 percent. Public finances in Britain, which does not use the euro, have shown signs of slowing deterioration in recent months, but remain at record levels. Britain does have some advantages over countries like Greece: it prints the currency in which its liabilities are denominated, so it can devalue and make its exports more competitive. It is considered a surer bet for repayment, maintaining a triple-A credit rating. Still, the new coalition government headed by Prime Minister David Cameron of the Conservative Party has made cutting debt its priority to get the country 'back open for business.' Britain was hit particularly hard by the global credit crunch because of its huge financial sector, and the government carried out a multibillion pound bailout of major banks even as levels of personal debt soared among consumers. Like the US, it also faced a collapsed real estate bubble. The European Union has warned that Britain's deficit is likely to hit 12 percent of GDP this year, four times what the bloc considers acceptable. Debt is expected to reach 88 percent in 2011 or 2012, overtaking the EU average. ------ NETHERLANDS: 2009 debt: 61 percent of GDP Deficit: 3.4 percent of GDP 2010 growth estimate: 1.5 percent. 2011 estimate: 2.0 percent. Unemployment: 5.9 percent. The Netherlands went into the financial crisis with the best national finances it had seen in decades, and all main parties committed to pruning the welfare state -- with different emphases. The country has a competitive, open economy, natural gas resources, and is a net exporter, especially of agricultural goods. But its unusually large financial services sector led to an abrupt spike in national debt largely due to bailouts during the crisis. Although the Dutch are in an anti-Europe mood and many would love to see the return of the guilder, policymakers recognize that but for its euro-membership, the Netherlands might well have wound up like Iceland and seen its currency and banking system collapse. Dutch national elections are scheduled for June 9, and major battlegrounds include whether the retirement age should be raised to 67 from 65 and whether to scrap the tax deduction on mortgage interest. Anti-Islam politician Geert Wilders is trying to halt a big slide in the polls by arguing that non-Western immigrants cost the country (EURO)7 billion per year. ------ SPAIN: 2009 debt: 55.2 percent of GDP Deficit: 11.2 percent of GDP 2010 growth: minus 0.3 percent. 2011 estimate: 1.3 percent. Unemployment: 20.05 percent. Spain is grappling with the twin woes of a moribund economy and a lopsided deficit that is triggering fears of a Greek-style debt crisis. The government has cut spending to chip away at the deficit, but acknowledged that this will also chop half a percentage point off its forecast for growth in 2011, down to 1.3 percent. And there are doubts over whether that level of growth can generate net employment and ease the 20 percent jobless rate. Before the economic crisis, Spain relied heavily on free-flowing credit and a red-hot construction sector. Now it is search of a new growth model and there are no obvious solutions. Business leaders and many economists say the government must reform the stodgy labor market to encourage employers to hire and restore a climate of confidence. ------ ",3

4,"Text of President Barack Obama's speech at Cairo University, as provided by CQ Transcriptions. ------ Good afternoon. I am honored to be in the timeless city of Cairo and to be hosted by two remarkable institutions. For over a thousand years, al-Azhar has, had stood as a beacon of Islamic learning. And for over a century, Cairo University has been a source of Egypt's advancement. Together, you represent the harmony between tradition and progress. I'm grateful for your hospitality and the hospitality of the people of Egypt. And I'm also proud to carry with me the good will of the American people and a greeting of peace from Muslim communities in my country: Assalamu Alaikum. (APPLAUSE) We meet at a time of great tension between the United States and Muslims around the world, tension rooted in historical forces that go beyond any current policy debate. The relationship between Islam and the West includes centuries of coexistence and cooperation but also conflict and religious wars. More recently, tension has been fed by colonialism that denied rights and opportunities to many Muslims and a Cold War in which Muslim majority countries were too often treated as proxies without regard to their own aspirations. Moreover, the sweeping change brought by modernity and globalization led many Muslims to view the West as hostile to the traditions of Islam. Violent extremists have exploited these tensions in a small but potent minority of Muslims. The attacks of September 11, 2001, and the continued efforts of these extremists to engage in violence against civilians has led some in my country to view Islam as inevitably hostile not only to America and Western countries but also to human rights. All this has bred more fear and more mistrust. So long as our relationship is defined by our differences, we will empower those who sow hatred rather than peace, those who promote conflict rather than the cooperation that can help all of our people achieve justice and prosperity. And this cycle of suspicion and discord must end. I've come here to Cairo to seek a new beginning between the United States and Muslims around the world, one based on mutual interest and mutual respect, and one based upon the truth that America and Islam are not exclusive and need not be in competition. Instead, they overlap and share common principles, principles of justice and progress, tolerance and the dignity of all human beings. I do so recognizing that change cannot happen overnight. I know there's been a lot of publicity about this speech, but no single speech can eradicate years of mistrust nor can I answer in the time that I have this afternoon all the complex questions that brought us to this point. But I am convinced that in order to move forward, we must say openly to each other the things we hold in our hearts and that too often are said only behind closed doors. There must be a sustained effort to listen to each other, to learn from each other, to respect one another, and to seek common ground. As the holy Quran tells us: 'Be conscious of God and speak always the truth.' (APPLAUSE) That is what I will try to do today, to speak the truth as best I can. Humbled by the task before us and firm in my belief that the interests we share as human beings are far more powerful than the forces that drive us apart. Now, part of this conviction is rooted in my own experience. I'm a Christian. But my father came from a Kenyan family that includes generations of Muslims. As a boy, I spent several years in Indonesia and heard the call of the azaan at the break of dawn and at the fall of dusk. As a young man, I worked in Chicago communities where many found dignity and peace in their Muslim faith. As a student of history, I also know civilization's debt to Islam. It was Islam at places like al-Azhar that carried the light of learning through so many centuries, paving the way for Europe's Renaissance and Enlightenment. It was innovation in Muslim communities... (APPLAUSE) It was innovation in Muslim communities that developed the order of algebra, our magnetic compass and tools of navigation, our mastery of pens and printing, our understanding of how disease spreads and how it can be healed. Islamic culture has given us majestic arches and soaring spires, timeless poetry and cherished music, elegant calligraphy and places of peaceful contemplation. And throughout history, Islam has demonstrated through words and deeds the possibilities of religious tolerance and racial equality. (APPLAUSE) I also know that Islam has always been a part of America's story. The first nation to recognize my country was Morocco. In signing the Treaty of Tripoli in 1796, our second president, John Adams, wrote: 'The United States has in itself no character of enmity against the laws, religion or tranquility of Muslims.' And since our founding, American Muslims have enriched the United States. They have fought in our wars. They have served in our government. They have stood for civil rights. They have started businesses. They have taught at our universities. They've excelled in our sports arenas. They've won Nobel Prizes, built our tallest building and lit the Olympic torch. And when the first Muslim American was recently elected to Congress, he took the oath to defend our Constitution using the same holy Quran that one of our founding fathers, Thomas Jefferson, kept in his personal library. (APPLAUSE) So I have known Islam on three continents before coming to the region where it was first revealed. That experience guides my conviction that partnership between America and Islam must be based on what Islam is, not what it isn't. And I consider it part of my responsibility as president of the United States to fight against negative stereotypes of Islam wherever they appear. (APPLAUSE) But that same principle must apply to Muslim perceptions of America. Just as... (APPLAUSE) Just as Muslims do not fit a crude stereotype, America is not the crude stereotype of a self-interested empire. The United States has been one of the greatest sources of progress that the world has ever known. We were born out of revolution against an empire. We were founded upon the ideal that all are created equal. And we have shed blood and struggled for centuries to give meaning to those words, within our borders and around the world. We are shaped by every culture. Drawn from every end of the Earth, and dedicated to a simple concept, E pluribus unum: Out of many, one. Now much has been made of the fact that an African-American with the name Barack Hussein Obama could be elected president. (APPLAUSE) But my personal story is not so unique. The dream of opportunity for all people has not come true for everyone in America, but its promise exists for all who come to our shores. And that includes nearly 7 million American Muslims in our country today who, by the way, enjoy incomes and educational levels that are higher than the American average. Moreover, freedom in America is indivisible from the freedom to practice one's religion. That is why there is a mosque in every state in our union and over 1,200 mosques within our borders. That's why the United States government has gone to court to protect the right of women and girls to wear the hijab, and to punish those who would deny it. So let there be no doubt... (APPLAUSE) ... let there be no doubt, Islam is a part of America. And I believe that America holds within her the truth that regardless of race, religion, or station in life, all of us share common aspirations: to live in peace and security, to get an education and to work with dignity, to love our families, our communities, and our God. These things we share. This is the hope of all humanity. Of course, recognizing our common humanity is only the beginning of our task. Words alone cannot meet the needs of our people. These needs will be met only if we act boldly in the years ahead. And if we understand that the challenges we face are shared and our failure to meet them will hurt us all. For we have learned from recent experience that when a financial system weakens in one country, prosperity is hurt everywhere. When a new flu infects one human being, all are at risk. When one nation pursues a nuclear weapon, the risk of nuclear attack rises for all nations. When violent extremists operate in one stretch of mountains, people are endangered across an ocean. When innocents in Bosnia and Darfur are slaughtered, that is a stain on our collective conscience. (APPLAUSE) That is what it means to share this world in the 21st Century. That is the responsibility we have to one another as human beings. This is a difficult responsibility to embrace, for human history has often been a record of nations and tribes, and, yes, religions subjugating one another in pursuit of their own interests. Yet in this new age, such attitudes are self-defeating. Given our interdependence, any world order that elevates one nation or group of people over another will inevitably fail. So whatever we think of the past, we must not be prisoners to it. Our problems must be dealt with through partnership, our progress must be shared. (APPLAUSE) Now, that does not mean we should ignore sources of tension. Indeed, it suggests the opposite. We must face these tensions squarely. And so, in that spirit, let me speak as clearly and as plainly as I can about some specific issues that I believe we must finally confront together. The first issue that we have to confront is violent extremism in all its forms. In Ankara, I made clear that America is not and never will be at war with Islam. (APPLAUSE) We will, however, relentlessly confront violent extremists who pose a grave threat to our security because we reject the same thing that people of all faiths reject, the killing of innocent men, women and children. And it is my first duty as president to protect the American people. The situation in Afghanistan demonstrates America's goals and our need to work together. Over seven years ago, the United States pursued al-Qaida and the Taliban with broad international support. We did not go by choice. We went because of necessity. I'm aware that there's still some who would question or even justify the offense of 9/11. But let us be clear. Al-Qaida killed nearly 3,000 people on that day. The victims were innocent men, women and children from America and many other nations who had done nothing to harm anybody. And yet al-Qaida chose to ruthlessly murder these people, claimed credit for the attack, and even now states their determination to kill on a massive scale. They have affiliates in many countries and are trying to expand their reach. These are not opinions to be debated. These are facts to be dealt with. Make no mistake, we do not want to keep our troops in Afghanistan. We see no military -- we seek no military bases there. It is agonizing for America to lose our young men and women. It is costly and politically difficult to continue this conflict. We would gladly bring every single one of our troops home if we could be confident that there were not violent extremists in Afghanistan, and now Pakistan, determined to kill as many Americans as they possibly can. But that is not yet the case. And that's why we're partnering with a coalition of 46 countries. And despite the costs involved, America's commitment will not weaken. Indeed, none of us should tolerate these extremists. They have killed in many countries. They have killed people of different faiths but, more than any other, they have killed Muslims. Their actions are irreconcilable with the rights of human beings, the progress of nations, and with Islam. The holy Quran teaches that whoever kills an innocent is as -- it is as it if has killed all mankind. (APPLAUSE) And the holy Quran also says whoever saves a person, it is as if he has saved all mankind. (APPLAUSE) The enduring faith of over a billion people is so much bigger than the narrow hatred of a few. Islam is not part of the problem in combating violent extremism; it is an important part of promoting peace. Now, we also know that military power alone is not going solve the problems in Afghanistan and Pakistan. That's why we plan to invest $1.5 billion each year over the next five years to partner with Pakistanis to build schools and hospitals, roads and businesses, and hundreds of millions to help those who've been displaced. That's why we are providing more than $2.8 billion to help Afghans develop their economy and deliver services that people depend on. Now, let me also address the issue of Iraq. Unlike Afghanistan, Iraq was a war of choice that provoked strong differences in my country and around the world. Although I believe that the Iraqi people are ultimately better off without the tyranny of Saddam Hussein, I also believe that events in Iraq have reminded America of the need to use diplomacy and build international consensus to resolve our problems whenever possible. (APPLAUSE) Indeed, we can recall the words of Thomas Jefferson, who said: 'I hope that our wisdom will grow with our power and teach us that the less we use our power, the greater it will be.' Today America has a dual responsibility to help Iraq forge a better future and to leave Iraq to Iraqis. I have made it clear to the Iraqi people... (APPLAUSE) I have made it clear to the Iraqi people that we pursue no basis and no claim on their territory or resources. Iraq's sovereignty is its own. And that's why I ordered the removal of our combat brigades by next August. That is why we will honor our agreement with Iraq's democratically-elected government to remove combat troops from Iraqi cities by July and to remove all of our troops from Iraq by 2012. (APPLAUSE) We will help Iraq train its security forces and develop its economy. But we will support a secure and united Iraq as a partner and never as a patron. And finally, just as America can never tolerate violence by extremists, we must never alter or forget our principles. 9/11 was an enormous trauma to our country. The fear and anger that it provoked was understandable. But in some cases, it led us to act contrary to our traditions and our ideals. We are taking concrete actions to change course. I have unequivocally prohibited the use of torture by the United States. And I have ordered the prison at Guantanamo Bay closed by early next year. (APPLAUSE) So America will defend itself, respectful of the sovereignty of nations and the rule of law. And we will do so in partnership with Muslim communities, which are also threatened. The sooner the extremists are isolated and unwelcome in Muslim communities, the sooner we will all be safer. Now, the second major source of tension that we need to discuss is the situation between Israelis, Palestinians and the Arab world. America's strong bonds with Israel are well-known. This bond is unbreakable. It is based upon cultural and historical ties and the recognition that the aspiration for a Jewish homeland is rooted in a tragic history that cannot be denied. Around the world the Jewish people were persecuted for centuries. And anti-Semitism in Europe culminated in an unprecedented Holocaust. Tomorrow I will visit Buchenwald, which was part of a network of camps where Jews were enslaved, tortured, shot and gassed to death by the Third Reich. Six million Jews were killed, more than the entire Jewish population of Israel today. Denying that fact is baseless. It is ignorant, and it is hateful. Threatening Israel with destruction or repeating vile stereotypes about Jews is deeply wrong and only serves to evoke in the minds of the Israelis this most painful of memories while preventing the peace that the people of this region deserve. On the other hand, it is also undeniable that the Palestinian people, Muslims and Christians, have suffered in pursuit of a homeland. For more than 60 years, they've endured the pain of dislocation. Many wait in refugee camps in the West Bank and Gaza and neighboring lands for a life of peace and security that they have never been able to lead. They endure the daily humiliations, large and small, that come with occupation. So let there be no doubt, the situation for the Palestinian people is intolerable. And America will not turn our backs on the legitimate Palestinian aspiration for dignity, opportunity and a state of their own. (APPLAUSE) For decades, then, there has been a stalemate. Two peoples with legitimate aspirations, each with a painful history that makes compromise elusive. It's easy to point fingers. For Palestinians to point to the displacement brought about by Israel's founding and for Israelis to point to the constant hostility and attacks throughout its history, from within its borders as well as beyond. But if we see this conflict only from one side or the other, then we will be blind to the truth. The only resolution is for the aspirations of both sides to be met through two states, where Israelis and Palestinians each live in peace and security. (APPLAUSE) That is in Israel's interests, Palestine's interests, America's interests and the world's interests. And that's why I intend to personally pursue this outcome with all of the patience and dedication that the task requires. The obligations -- the obligations that the parties have agreed to under the Road Map are clear. For peace to come, it is time for them and all of us to live up to our responsibilities. Palestinians must abandon violence. Resistance through violence and killing is wrong and it does not succeed. For centuries, black people in America suffered the lash of the whip as slaves and the humiliation of segregation. But it was not violence that won full and equal rights. It was a peaceful and determined insistence upon the ideals at the center of America's founding. This same story can be told by people from South Africa to South Asia, to Eastern Europe to Indonesia. It's a story with a simple truth: violence is a dead end. It is a sign neither of courage nor power to shoot rockets at sleeping children or to blow up old women on a bus. That's not how moral authority is claimed, that's how it is surrendered. Now is the time for Palestinians to focus on what they can build. The Palestinian Authority must develop its capacity to govern with institutions that serve the needs of its people. Hamas does have support among some Palestinians, but they also have to recognize they have responsibilities, to play a role in fulfilling Palestinian aspirations, to unify the Palestinian people, Hamas must put an end to violence, recognize past agreements, recognize Israel's right to exist. At the same time, Israelis must acknowledge that just as Israel's right to exist cannot be denied, neither can Palestine's. The United States does not accept the legitimacy of continued Israeli settlements. (APPLAUSE) This construction violates previous agreements and undermines efforts to achieve peace. It is time for these settlements to stop. (APPLAUSE) And Israel must also live up to its obligation to ensure that Palestinians can live and work and develop their society. Just as it devastates Palestinian families, the continuing humanitarian crisis in Gaza does not serve Israel's security, neither does the continuing lack of opportunity in the West Bank. Progress in the daily lives of the Palestinian people must be a critical part of a road to peace. And Israel must take concrete steps to enable such progress. And, finally, the Arab states must recognize that the Arab Peace Initiative was an important beginning, but not the end of their responsibility. The Arab-Israeli conflict should no longer be used to distract the people of Arab nations from other problems. Instead, it must be a cause for action to help the Palestinian people develop the institutions that will sustain their state, to recognize Israel's legitimacy and to choose progress over a self-defeating focus on the past. America will align our policies with those who pursue peace, and we will say in public what we say in private to Israelis and Palestinians and Arabs. We cannot impose peace. But privately, many Muslims recognize that Israel will not go away. Likewise, many Israelis recognize the need for a Palestinian state. It is time for us to act on what everyone knows to be true. Too many tears have been shed, too much blood has been shed. All of us have a responsibility to work for the day when the mothers of Israelis and Palestinians could, can see their children grow up without fear, when the holy land of the three great faiths is the place of peace that God intended it to be, when Jerusalem is a secure and lasting home for Jews and Christians and Muslims and a place for all of the children of Abraham to mingle peacefully together as in the story of Isra -- as in the story of Isra, when Moses, Jesus, and Mohammed -- peace be upon them -- joined in prayer. (APPLAUSE) The third source of tension is our shared interest in the rights and responsibilities of nations on nuclear weapons. This issue has been a source of tension between the United States and the Islamic Republic of Iran. For many years, Iran has defined itself, in part, by its opposition to my country. And there is, in fact, a tumultuous history between us. In the middle of the Cold War, the United States played a role in the overthrow of a democratically elected Iranian government. Since the Islamic revolution, Iran has played a role in acts of hostage taking and violence against U.S. troops and civilians. This history is well known. Rather than remain trapped in the past, I've made it clear to Iran's leaders and people that my country is prepared to move forward. The question now is not what Iran is against but, rather, what future it wants to build. I recognize it will be hard to overcome decades of mistrust, but we will proceed with courage, rectitude, and resolve. There will be many issues to discussion between our two countries, and we are willing to move forward without preconditions on the basis of mutual respect. But it is clear to all concerned that when it comes to nuclear weapons, we have reached a decisive point. This is not simply about America's interests. It's about preventing a nuclear arms race in the Middle East that could lead this region and the world down a hugely dangerous path. Now, I understand those who protest that some countries have weapons that others do not. No single nations should pick and choose which nation holds nuclear weapons. And that's why I strongly reaffirmed America's commitment to seek a world in which no nations hold nuclear weapons. (APPLAUSE) And any nation, including Iran, should have the right to access peaceful nuclear power if it complies with its responsibilities under the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty. That commitment is at the core of the treaty. And it must be kept for all who fully abide by it. And I am hopeful that all countries in the region can share in this goal. The fourth issue that I will address is democracy. (APPLAUSE) I know there has been controversy about the promotion of democracy in recent years. And much of this controversy is connected to the war in Iraq. So let me be clear. No system of government can or should be imposed by one nation by any other. That does not lessen my commitment, however, to governments that reflect the will of the people. Each nation gives life to this principle in its own way, grounded in the traditions of its own people. America does not presume to know what is best for everyone, just as we would not presume to pick the outcome of a peaceful election. But I do have an unyielding belief that all people yearn for certain things: the ability to speak your mind and have a say in how you are governed, confidence in the rule of law and the equal administration of justice, government that is transparent and doesn't steal from the people, the freedom to live as you choose. These are not just American ideas. They are human rights. And that is why we will support them everywhere. (APPLAUSE) Now, there is no straight line to realize this promise. But this much is clear. Governments that protect these rights are ultimately more stable, successful and secure. Suppressing ideas never succeeds in making them go away. America respects the right of all peaceful and law-abiding voices to be heard around the world, even if we disagree with them. And we will welcome all elected, peaceful governments, provided they govern with respect for all their people. This last point is important because there are some who advocate for democracy only when they're out of power. Once in power, they are ruthless in suppressing the rights of others. (APPLAUSE) So no matter where it takes hold, government of the people and by the people sets a single standard for all who would hold power. You must maintain your power through consent, not coercion. You must respect the rights of minorities and participate with a spirit of tolerance and compromise. You must place the interests of your people and the legitimate workings of the political process above your party. Without these ingredients, elections alone do not make true democracy. (AUDIENCE MEMBER SHOUTS) Thank you. (APPLAUSE) The fifth issue that we must address together is religious freedom. Islam has a proud tradition of tolerance. We see it in the history of Andalusia and Cordoba during the Inquisition. I saw it firsthand as a child in Indonesia where devout Christians worshipped freely in an overwhelmingly Muslim country. That is the spirit we need today. People in every country should be free to choose and live their faith based upon the persuasion of the mind and the heart and the soul. This tolerance is essential for religion to thrive. But it's being challenged in many different ways. Among some Muslims, there's a disturbing tendency to measure one's own faith by the rejection of somebody else's faith. The richness of religious diversity must be upheld, whether it is for Maronites in Lebanon or the Copts in Egypt. (APPLAUSE) And if we are being honest, fault lines must be closed among Muslims as well as the divisions between Sunni and Shia have led to tragic violence, particularly in Iraq. Freedom of religion is central to the ability of peoples to live together. We must always examine the ways in which people protect it. For instance, in the United States, rules on charitable giving have made it harder for Muslims to fulfill their religious obligation. That's why I'm committed to work with American Muslims to ensure that they can fulfill zakat. Likewise, it is important for Western countries to avoid impeding Muslim citizens from practicing religion as they see fit, for instance, by dictating what clothes a Muslim woman should wear. We can't disguise hostility towards any religion behind the pretense of liberalism. In fact, faith should bring us together. And that's why we're forging service projects in America to bring together Christians, Muslims and Jews. That's why we welcome efforts like Saudi Arabian King Abdullah's interfaith dialogue and Turkey's leadership in the Alliance of Civilizations. Around the world, we can turn dialogue into interfaith service so bridges between peoples lead to action, whether it is combating malaria in Africa or providing relief after a natural disaster. The sixth issue -- the sixth issue that I want to address is women's rights. (APPLAUSE) I know, and you can tell from this audience, that there is a healthy debate about this issue. I reject the view of some in the West that a woman who chooses to cover her hair is somehow less equal. But I do believe that a woman who is denied an education is denied equality. (APPLAUSE) And it is no coincidence that countries where women are well-educated are far more likely to be prosperous. Now let me be clear, issues of women's equality are by no means simply an issue for Islam. In Turkey, Pakistan, Bangladesh, Indonesia, we've seen Muslim-majority countries elect a woman to lead. Meanwhile, the struggle for women's equality continues in many aspects of American life and in countries around the world. I am convinced that our daughters can contribute just as much to society as our sons. (APPLAUSE) Our common prosperity will be advanced by allowing all humanity, men and women, to reach their full potential. I do not believe that women must make the same choices as men in order to be equal. And I respect those women who choose to live their lives in traditional roles. But it should be their choice. That is why the United States will partner with any Muslim-majority country to support expanded literacy for girls and to help young women pursue employment through micro-financing that helps people live their dreams. (APPLAUSE) Finally, I want to discuss economic development and opportunity. I know that for many, the face of globalization is contradictory. The Internet and television can bring knowledge and information but also offensive sexuality and mindless violence into the home. Trade can bring new wealth and opportunities but also huge disruptions and change in communities. In all nations, including America, this change can bring fear; fear that, because of modernity, we lose control over our economic choices, our politics, and most importantly, our identities, those things we most cherish about our communities, our families, our traditions and our faith. But I also know that human progress cannot be denied. There need not be contradictions between development and tradition. Countries like Japan and South Korea grew their economies enormously while maintaining distinct cultures. The same is true for the astonishing progress within Muslim majority countries from Kuala Lumpur to Dubai. In ancient times and in our times, Muslim communities have been at the forefront of innovation and education. And this is important because no development strategy can be based only upon what comes out of the ground nor can it be sustained while young people are out of work. Many Gulf States have enjoyed great wealth as a consequence of oil, and some are beginning to focus it on broader development. But all of us must recognize that education and innovation will be the currency of the 21st century. And in too... (APPLAUSE) And in too many Muslim communities, there remains underinvestment in these areas. I am emphasizing such investment within my own country. And while America, in the past, has focused on oil and gas when it comes to this part of the world, we new seek a broader engagement. On education, we will expand change programs and increase scholarships like the one that brought my father to America. (APPLAUSE) At the same time, we will encourage more Americans to study in Muslim communities. And we will match promising Muslim students with internships in America, invest in online learning for teachers and children around the world and create a new, online network so a young person in Kansas can communicate instantly with a young person in Cairo. On economic development, we will create a new core of business volunteers to partner with counterparts in Muslim majority countries. And I will host a summit on entrepreneurship this year to identify how we can deepen ties between business leaders, foundations and social entrepreneurs in the United States and Muslim communities around the world. On science and technology, we will launch a new fund to support technological development in Muslim majority country and to help transfer ideas to the marketplace so they can create more jobs. We will open centers of scientific excellence in Africa, the Middle East and Southeast Asia and appoint new science envoys to collaborate on programs that develop new sources of energy, create green jobs, digitize records, clean water, grow new crops. Today, I'm announcing a new global effort with the organization of the Islamic Conference to eradicate polio. And we will also expand partnerships with Muslim communities to promote child and maternal health. All these things must be done in partnership. Americans are ready to join with citizens and governments, community organizations, religious leaders, and businesses in Muslim communities around the world to help our people pursue a better life. The issues that I have described will not be easy to address, but we have a responsibility to join together to behalf of the world that we seek, a world where extremists no longer threaten our people and American troops have come home; a world where Israelis and Palestinians are each secure in a state of their own and nuclear energy is used for peaceful purposes, a world where governments serve their citizens and the rights of all God's children are respected. Those are mutual interests. That is the world we seek. But we can only achieve it together. I know there are many, Muslim and non-Muslim, who question whether we can forge this new beginning. Some are eager to stoke the flames of division and to stand in the way of progress. Some suggest that it isn't worth the effort, that we are fated to disagree and civilizations are doomed to clash. Many more are simply skeptical that real change can occur. There is so much fear, so much mistrust that has built up over the years. But if we choose to be bound by the past, we will never move forward. And I want to particularly say this to young people of every faith in every country. You more than anyone have the ability to reimagine the world, the remake this world. All of us share this world for but a brief moment in time. The question is whether we spend that time focused on what pushes us apart or whether we commit ourselves to an effort, a sustained effort to find common ground, to focus on the future we seek for our children and to respect the dignity of all human beings. It's easier to start wars than to end them. It's easier to blame others than to look inward. It's easier to see what is different about someone than to find the things we share. But we should choose the right path, not just the easy path. There is one rule that lies at the heart of every religion, that we do unto others as we would have them do unto us. (APPLAUSE) This truth transcends nations and peoples, a belief that isn't new, that isn't black or white or brown, that isn't Christian or Muslim or Jew. It's a belief that pulsed in the cradle of civilization and that still beats in the hearts of billions around the world. It's a faith in other people. And it's what brought me here today. We have the power to make the world we seek, but only if we have the courage to make a new beginning, keeping in mind what has been written. The holy Quran tells us: 'Mankind, we have created you male and a female. And we have made you into nations and tribes so that you may know one another.' The Talmud tells us: 'The whole of the Torah is for the purpose of promoting peace.' The holy Bible tells us: 'Blessed are the peacemakers, for they shall be called sons of God.' (APPLAUSE) The people of the world can live together in peace. We know that is God's vision. Now that must be our work here on Earth. Thank you. And may God's peace be upon you. Thank you very much. Thank you. END ",3
4,"The Obama administration indicated to reporters this week that long-awaited action codifying the Bush-era policy of indefinite detention for suspected terrorists would be put in place through executive order. This is both very bad and an improvement over the status quo. Rather than abandoning indefinite detention, President Obama is seeking simply to make the process fairer. The coming proposal improves on the Bush administration detention review process in that it would reportedly be more adversarial - detainees would be represented by a lawyer, and the boards would be made up of more than just military officials. The process would be, as The New York Times describes it, basically a kind of 'parole board' for suspected terrorists. The use of indefinite military detention in armed conflict is well-established, but it's not clear whether those who would be detained under this policy are 'battlefield captures' or whether military detention is a smoke screen for holding indefinitely people who should be charged with a crime or released. Complicating this is the reality that the fight with al-Qaida has no defined endpoint. The administration could argue that by using an executive order, it's avoiding more constraints on detainee rights than would probably be the result of going through a Republican Congress. An executive order means that indefinite detention isn't a 'permanent' fixture of U.S. law. As University of Texas law professor Robert Chesney told ProPublica, an executive order 'doesn't have staying power if the next administration doesn't want it.' The danger is that the fight against al-Qaida may be endless, and it's hard to remember a president willingly ceding executive power. One question is whether the proposal would apply merely to the Bush administration 'legacy cases' at Guantanamo, which include individuals difficult to try in either military or civilian forums because of abuse they endured during the Bush administration, or future cases as well. While indefinite detention would officially become part of the Obama administration's national security policy, the proposal also provides a ray of hope for those detainees who have lost their habeas cases and are being held indefinitely with little chance of release. The proposal is basically what we've come to expect from the Obama administration on security and civil liberties. Having promised to reverse the trajectory of Bush-era national security policies, Obama has settled on making them marginally more lawful and humane. It's not nothing, but it's not what Obama promised - or what much of the left hoped for.

4,"Normally, a three-day weekend that feels never-ending is cause for celebration. But in the case of the urban comedy 'Lottery Ticket,' a few days can be a long time for the main character _ and for the audience. A long Fourth of July weekend is all that stands between recent high school graduate Kevin (played by rapper Bow Wow) and a $370 million jackpot. Owner of the winning ticket, Kevin can claim his prize once the next workday begins, but until then he has to contend with the other inhabitants of his housing project, including a gold digger, a muscly ex-con and a wealth of questionably intentioned friends. 'Do you know what could happen in three whole days?' Kevin wonders. The answer is a jumble of comedy and drama with a sprinkling of 'After School Special' messaging and some head-scratchingly bad choices. Most people in such a quandary would, perhaps, hide in a closet at a friend's house. But writers Erik White (who also directs) and Abdul Williams have the young man make decisions far beyond the potential for suspended disbelief. Disclosing his new wealth to the whole neighborhood? Check. Taking money from a loan shark with a brigade of Bentleys in a dark warehouse? Check. Getting busy with an unabashed gold digger who wants to be his 'baby mama'? ('This is my lottery ticket,' she claims, gesturing to her partially disrobed brick house of a body.) Gross and, yes, check. Despite the many uneven moments, there are some bright spots. Bow Wow has surprisingly good comic timing, especially when said man-eater begins aggressively seducing him under a mirrored ceiling. A scene with a fancy-footed and opportunistic preacher (Mike Epps) proves especially memorable, as the man fondles his long silky hair while narrating a slide show of the things God wants him to have, including a nicer church, a mansion that screams Miami and a young, hot wife. Most unexpected of all is Faheem Najm's (a.k.a. rapper T-Pain) brief and infectiously amusing portrayal of a liquor store clerk. It would seem the Grammy winner has talents beyond singing 'I'm N Luv (Wit a Stripper).' But things really slow down during the movie's ill-advised forays into drama. When a curious old man living in a cellar (played by Ice Cube) discusses his past as a sparring partner for some of boxing's greatest legends, resplendent music begins to soar before he declares, 'I just wish someone would come along and make a difference.' He might as well have screamed, 'This is foreshadowing.' When Kevin gets into a fight with his best friend, the pair hams it up to the point of Oscar clip territory, and Kevin's behavior starts to look an awful lot like Frodo's, buckling under the weight of the ring. In the end, this three-day weekend takes up little more than an hour and a half, but it might be a holiday worth skipping. PG-13. Contains sexual content, language including a drug reference, violence and brief underage drinking. 95 minutes. ",1
4,"Welcome word came late Wednesday afternoon that NBA Commissioner David Stern has suspended Gilbert Arenas from the Washington Wizards for an indefinite period, without pay. Stern originally thought it prudent to refrain from action pending the criminal investigation of a locker-room dispute involving Arenas, guns and a teammate. But in a statement on the NBA Web site, Sterns said that Arenas' 'ongoing conduct has led me to conclude that he is not currently fit to take the court in an NBA game.' No doubt Stern's about-face was prompted by Arenas' behavior _ captured in a photo featured on The Post's Sports front Wednesday _ in which he, thumbs up, index fingers out, pretends to shoot a bunch of his teammates who, in turn, just yukked it up. I found myself disgusted by these grown men _ supposed role models _ making sport of shooting another human being. And I couldn't help wondering how Abe Pollin, who died in November, would have reacted. So unsettled was Pollin by the carnage of gun violence that in the late 1990s he changed the name of this city's basketball team. He could not in good conscience promote a team called the Bullets, he said, when people _ many of them children _ were losing their lives. Pollin acted shortly after Israeli Prime Minister Yitzhak Rabin, a longtime friend of his, died as the result of a gun wielded by an assassin. He stood in the spot where Rabin was shot, Pollin told The New York Times. 'Bullets connote killing, violence, death. Our slogan used to be, `Faster than a speeding bullet.' That's no longer appropriate.' Pollin knew that while tinkering with tradition might anger fans, principle was more important. I suspect Pollin would have thought: How dare Arenas flout the law and league regulations by bringing firearms into Verizon Center? How dare he use his young children to try to cover his dangerous behavior? How dare he be so reckless as to use guns to (supposedly) play a joke on a friend? And how dare his teammates just sit back and laugh? A grand jury is investigating Arenas' actions. I hope it shows him and his teammates that this is no laughing matter. Guns are not status symbols, and violence is never to be tolerated. In other words, Arenas and the Wizards _ indeed, all of us _ should live up to Abe Pollin's example.

4,"History is usually made by a small group of passionate people. On Dec. 7, history was made by a small group of parents in Compton, Calif. Their children attend McKinley Elementary School - a school that has been defined as failing for the past 10 years. Using a new power known as the 'parent trigger,' which I fought for and state legislators approved last year, these Compton parents banded together to demand change. The legislation allows parents of students at troubled schools to demand such significant reforms as closing a school, replacing a school's management or most of its staff, or reorganizing a school into a charter, if 51 percent of parents sign a petition. McKinley Elementary is being reorganized and will soon be transformed into a charter school run by Celerity Educational Group, which is successfully operating three other schools in California. Some have called this action 'the shot heard across the country' - and they're not overstating the case. To get some perspective of the scope of this new power, consider the heartwrenching stories brought to public attention this year in the documentary 'Waiting for Superman,' which focuses on the failures of our public education system. Without the power of the trigger legislation, parents whose children are in what the documentary and others call 'dropout factories' have only one avenue to save their children. They must win a lottery to get them into a highly performing charter school. Across the country, millions of families' prayers go unanswered. These parents are left to face the bleak reality that their child will be forever stuck in a failing school and a failing system. The exit doors may as well be chained. For millions of low-income families, this means that their child is doomed to a life of unrealized potential. For millions of California families, this is the shattering of the American dream. Now, however, for the first time in California history, these historically underserved parents have new power and new choice. The package of reforms I signed in January gives parents significant options for changing their child's school as well as the freedom to leave failing schools or send their child to a new school or even a new district. Schools are eligible for the 51 percent trigger if they have been judged under state standards to have shown no progress for three consecutive years. While leaders of the State Teachers Union have threatened legal action to try to stop parents from using this groundbreaking power, I am confident that if they try to thwart the public, the courts will end up upholding this important bipartisan legislation. Changes such as replacing a school's principal and staff do not come unless there have been continued years of failure and a majority of parents banding together and signing a petition. This sort of majority-demanded restructuring is exactly what just happened at McKinley Elementary School. More than 60 percent of McKinley parents signed a petition and chose to convert to a charter school. Throughout history, all great movements have started at the grass-roots level, with ordinary citizens and communities rising up to demand change. In California, like in many other states, our public education system is not based on merit or holding the adults in whose care we have placed our children accountable. Some students get a good education, but others do not, and report after report reaches the same conclusion: No matter how much money we throw at the problem, unless the school is fundamentally fixed, we will not get the results in student performance we all deserve. Giving parents the power to hold their schools accountable is a giant step forward, and I believe that what happened in Compton is the beginning of a movement that will sweep the nation. The writer, a Republican, is governor of California. ",3
4,"Scientists reported Thursday they had developed a technique that can quickly create safe alternatives to human embryonic stem cells, a major advance toward developing a less controversial approach for treating for a host of medical problems. The researchers published a series of experiments showing they can use laboratory-made versions of naturally occurring biological signals to quickly convert ordinary skin cells into cells that appear virtually identical to embryonic stem cells. Moreover, the same strategy can then coax those cells to morph into specific tissues that would be a perfect match for transplantation into patients. The work, by a team led by Derrick Rossi of the Children's Hospital Boston, was praised by other researchers as a breakthrough. 'This paper is a major paper, in my view, in the field of regenerative medicine,' said Douglas Melton, who co-directs the Harvard Stem Cell Institute. Opponents of human embryonic stem cell research, meanwhile, seized on the advance as the most convincing evidence yet that alternatives were sufficient, rendering the morally questionable cells unnecessary. Rossi and other researchers, however, said that embryonic stem cell research was still crucial because, among other things, embryonic stem cells are irreplaceable for validating alternatives. Nevertheless, the announcement, described in a paper published in the journal Cell Stem Cell, could mark a pivotal moment in the long, contentious history of embryonic stem cell research. The advance comes as the future of federal funding for embryonic stem cell research hangs in doubt. A federal judge stunned the field Aug. 23 by ruling that the Obama administration's new more permissive policy for funding the research violated a federal law barring taxpayer dollars from being used for studies that involve destroying human embryos. The National Institutes of Health said that it supports research only on cells that have been obtained by privately funded scientists. An appeals court Tuesday let the NIH continue the funding as the case winds through the legal system. Scientists hope embryonic stem cells will lead to cures for diabetes, Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease, spinal cord injuries and a host of other ailments because they can turn into almost any tissue in the body. But they can be obtained only by destroying days-old embryos, which some consider equivalent to killing human life. In 2006, researchers discovered that they could coax adult cells into a state that appeared identical to embryonic stem cells, dubbed induced pluripotent stem cells (iPS cells), by activating four genes. Those cells could morph into various tissues in the same way that embryonic stem cells can. But the process involved inserting genes into cells using retroviruses, which raised the risk the cells could cause cancer. Since then, scientists have been racing to develop alternative methods. Several approaches, using chemicals or other types of viruses, have shown promise. But none has completely eliminated the safety concerns, and most have been slow and inefficient. The new approach involves molecules known as 'messenger RNA,' or mRNA, which the DNA inside cells use to create proteins they need carry out various vital functions. The researchers created mRNA molecules carrying the instructions for the cell's machinery to produce the four key proteins needed to reprogram themselves into iPS cells. After tinkering with the mRNA molecules in the laboratory to make signals that the cells would not destroy as dangerous invaders, the researchers found that a daily cocktail of their creations were surprisingly fast and efficient at reprogramming the cells. The approach converted the cells in about half the time of previous methods - only about 17 days - with surprising economy - up to 100 times more efficient than the standard approach. Moreover, detailed tests indicated the cells had not experienced any disturbing changes in their DNA caused by previous methods and were virtually identical to embryonic stem cells. In addition, the researchers went one step further and showed that they could use the approach to then coax the iPS cells they created into a specific type of cell, in this case muscle cells. t ",3

4,"The ground rules at a Gallaudet University speed-dating night were simple: Five minutes with each partner. When the time is up, everyone switches seats. Keep the conversations G-rated. And no talking allowed. The last rule was the easiest to follow, since Gallaudet is one of the few colleges in the world where American Sign Language dominates all nonwritten communication. 'Sooo . . .' signed organizer Aneesah Silvels, a graduate student, who used exaggerated arm movements for emphasis. 'It is time to start.' With a flurry of hand movements, about two dozen speed daters started to get to know one another on a recent Friday night in the campus student center. The questions would have been familiar to anyone who has been on a first date: Where are you from? What are you studying? What do you do for fun? But instead of a quiet, intimate conversation, it was easy for anyone who knows sign language to eavesdrop. Organizers had to keep shooing away spectators. That constant shortage of conversational privacy makes dating on the campus difficult - especially in such a small, tight-knit college community, which has about 2,000 undergraduates and 500 grad students. 'At a large university, you could have a one-night stand, and no one would know,' signed Emmanuel Felix, a sophomore from San Diego who is studying accounting. 'Here at Gallaudet, if you have a one-night stand, everyone knows.' Speed dating, in which singles can gather to spend a few minutes with several potential dates at one time, has gained popularity in the past decade, though the title character of the show 'Frasier' once deemed it 'all the stress and humiliation of a blind date, times 12.' The event was part of a class project for Silvels, who is studying deaf education. Each student in one of her graduate courses had to come up with a project that would explain Gallaudet to the Washington community or bring together different groups on campus. 'I have friends who have done speed dating and really liked it,' Silvels said. 'I thought this would be really fun because it's very adult-like.' She posted fliers around campus and promoted the event on Facebook, telling students to 'Be there or be single!' Felix and his friends were complaining about the campus dating scene when they saw a flier. 'We just started cracking up,' he said. 'But we decided, let's be positive.' The event began with many more women than men. The introductory bio swap usually included a quintessential Gallaudet question: Did you go to a traditional, mainstream high school or an all-deaf one? For students who have grown up in strong deaf communities, sign language is the native tongue and often a defining part of who they are. Students who attended traditional schools were usually one of just a few deaf kids, separated socially and academically from most of their classmates and pushed to learn to read lips. Technology also has changed the definition of deafness, as cochlear implants and hearing aids have allowed more people to increase their ability to hear. One student decided not to attend the event because he wouldn't be allowed to speak as he signed, a touchy topic on a campus where most select one or the other, Silvels said. One woman who attended Gallaudet's secondary school was paired with a man who attended a mainstream Florida high school. He marveled at how 'completely different' it was at Gallaudet and how he is more social because he can easily communicate with everyone. The university also has a growing number of hearing students, such as Silvels, who don't fit into either social group. 'Gallaudet is the world they always wanted. The teachers sign, all of the workers sign. Gallaudet is their heaven. . . . They don't want to destroy that culture,' said Silvels. 'I feel like I always have to have my guard up. I have to have thick skin.' At a break halfway through the event, many women, having scoped out their options, disappeared. 'It was a great way to meet new people,' Justyna Grela signed earnestly. 'We just have somewhere else to go.' Suddenly, there were more men than women. For the last round of dates, Felix didn't get paired up with anyone. He sat alone as his friends chatted with new partners 'I'm not really looking for a relationship. I'm not really boyfriend or husband material,' he signed. 'And, hey, I don't mind being a wingman.'

4,"The European Space Agency has taken the closest look yet at asteroid Lutetia in an extraordinary quest some 280 million miles in outer space between Mars and Jupiter. The comet-chaser Rosetta transmitted its first pictures from the largest asteroid ever visited by a satellite Saturday night after it flew by Lutetia as close as 1,900 miles (3,200 kilometers), ESA said in Darmstadt, Germany. 'These are fantastic and exciting pictures,' space agency scientist Rita Schulz said in a webcast presentation. She said it would take several weeks before all 400 pictures and all data from the high-precision instruments aboard Rosetta would come through to Earth. 'I am a very happy man,' said ESA manager David Southwood. 'It is a great day for European Science and for world science.' Though Lutetia was discovered some 150 years ago, for a long time it was little more than a point of light to those on Earth. Only recent high-resolution ground-based imaging has given a vague view of the asteroid, the agency said. 'At the moment we know very little about it,' Schulz said. Lutetia is believed to be 83.3 miles (134 kilometers) in diameter with a 'pronounced elongation,' but scientists have been puzzled as to what type of asteroid it is -- a 'primitive' one containing carbon compounds or a metallic asteroid. 'We are now going to get the details of this asteroid, which is very important,' Schulz said. 'There will be a lot of science coming from that mission.' Scientists hope to find in the information and images gathered by Rosetta clues to the history of comets and asteroids and of the solar system, Schulz said. For Rosetta, examining Lutetia and other asteroids is only a side event on its long journey to comet 67P/Churyumov-Gerasimenko -- the mission's destination, said project manager Gerhard Schwehm. Rosetta was launched in 2004 and is expected to reach its target in 2014. Though the wait is long, scientists are certain it is going to be worthwhile, Schwehm said. 'We want to study the material out of which the planets formed,' he said. This is possible only close up, he said. ",1
4,"The following editorial appeared in Thursday's Washington Post: It was just a week ago that a defiant Marion Barry tried to bully the special investigators who had detailed his latest ethical transgressions. He defended his conduct ('I'm a different kind of council member'), took umbrage ('even my public enemies ... have never implied that I ever took a penny that wasn't owed to me') and impugned the investigation ('Asking people about sexual relationships. Asking people if (they've) seen me do drugs. That is totally inappropriate'). So forgive us if Mr. Barry's newfound words of regret ring hollow to us. 'I am truly sorry. I am truly sorry,' the Ward 8 council member said Tuesday as he apologized for improperly giving a city contract to a girlfriend who, according to the findings of special counsel Robert S. Bennett, did poor work and shared the proceeds with Mr. Barry. He owned up to a lack of judgment but insisted he violated no laws. He said nothing of allegations that he steered thousands of dollars in city money to questionable groups that benefited his close friends and political supporters. The event _ during which Mr. Barry took no questions _ was cynically staged inside Union Temple Baptist Church in D.C. It brought to mind a similar scene in 1990 when, days after the then-mayor was caught on tape taking drags from a crack pipe, he showed up at another church in Southeast Washington to confess a 'weakness' for which he would seek help. Or the day four years ago in U.S. District Court, when Mr. Barry apologized profusely for failing to file tax returns and relapsing into drug use. 'How much longer do we have to hear a 73-year-old man discuss his lack of judgment?' asked council member David A. Catania, I-At Large. It is clear that Mr. Barry is hoping his apology will dissuade his colleagues from taking any action when the council meets next week; after all, it's worked before. The council can't remove Mr. Barry from office, but it could censure him, strip him of important committee assignments and refer the allegations to the U.S. attorney's office and the D.C. Office of Campaign Finance. Even if the council invokes the toughest sanctions available to it _ and we think it should _ it won't be enough to make up for what Mr. Barry's repeated misbehavior has cost the very people he professes to serve. It frankly is disgusting to hear Mr. Barry talk, as he did Tuesday, about the needs of his resource-poor community when his main agenda has been his own welfare. He seems not to recognize the connection between the deprivations of Ward 8 and his lack of effective leadership. If Mr. Barry were really sorry, he would realize it is time for him to make way for someone who can deliver. Or, at the very least, to pay back the money wasted on girlfriends and cronies. ",1

4,"In the view of certain members of Congress, the problem with constitutional rights in this country is that every American gets them. Once you are either born into citizenship or earn it through naturalization, it's almost impossible for the government to take it away. What has some lawmakers angry these days is that terrorism suspects get the full panoply of constitutional protections if, by some peculiar twist of fate, they happen to be American citizens. With the arrest of a Pakistani-born naturalized American charged with trying to car bomb Times Square, citizenship seems suddenly like one of those bizarre legal technicalities that stand in the way of justice and national security. It isn't, and it doesn't. Yes, agents read Faisal Shahzad the same Miranda warnings, and the law gives him the same due process rights that the Constitution grants the rest of us, including who knows how many law-abiding citizens he was apparently trying to kill. So what? The law already allows cops to delay the Miranda warning under exigent circumstances, such as the possibility that another bomb is about to detonate. Until they were satisfied there was no assault in the works, agents questioned Shahzad without reminding him he didn't have to talk. That is also what they did with the Christmas Day underwear bomber, arrested at the Detroit airport. It was only after initial questioning that authorities advised them of the right to remain silent and their right to counsel. In both cases, the suspects kept talking anyway. 'A stroke of good luck,' Sen. John Cornyn, R-Texas, called Shahzad's chattiness. 'A serious mistake,' is how Sen. John McCain, R-Ariz., characterized the Mirandizing of Shahzad. It was no mistake. Nor was it a mistake when agents during the previous administration Mirandized shoe bomber Richard Reid and every other suspected terrorist arrested on U.S. soil, no matter their nationality. But Sen. Joseph Lieberman, already a proponent of citizenship-stripping for suspected terrorists, is hoping the outrage over Mirandizing Shahzad will help push a bill he introduced this week. The Terrorist Expatriation Act would allow the de- Americanizing of anyone who supports any group the State Department says is a terrorist organization. An independent from Connecticut, Lieberman says the bill would merely update a 1940s-era law that says Americans who join forces with an enemy engaged in hostilities against the U.S. would lose their citizenship. First of all, the Supreme Court has made the existing law tricky to apply. A 1967 ruling said the government can't force expatriation on an unwilling citizen. The court later said the government can revoke citizenship for someone it can prove intended to relinquish his rights, say by signing up with an active enemy. Lieberman's idea would go so much further than the current law. Supporting the wrong organization, one which may have educational as well as terror-mongering facets, is a far cry from taking up arms against your country. And if the whole idea of the Lieberman law is to deny such a person the right to due process at the time of the arrest so that no Miranda reading is required, the timing is all wrong. Let me here quote, of all people, House Republican Minority Leader John Boehner. 'If they're a U.S. citizen, until they're convicted of some crime, I don't know how you would attempt to take their citizenship away,' Boehner told reporters. And of course you can't convict a citizen of a crime without, ahem, giving him due process of law. And that includes protection against self-incrimination, the right to remain silent and the right to counsel. The point behind the rigmarole is that without a fair trial, you can't really know who committed what wrongdoing, who has been framed or who is the victim of mistaken identity. In the unlikely event that Congress passes this bill, and in the even less likely event it is found to be constitutional, it couldn't and wouldn't apply retroactively to Shahzad, as Lieberman acknowledges. The ultimate aim of those unhappy about Mirandizing possible terrorists is to make sure they get no civilian trial and instead get tossed into a brig to await a military tribunal, if we ever get around to it. Oh, wait. We tried that with suspected dirty bomber Jose Padilla, a U.S. citizen arrested at O'Hare Airport in Chicago. He was kept in solitary confinement at a South Carolina naval brig for years. That brig thing-y didn't work out so well, so Padilla wound up in a civilian trial where he was convicted on completely different charges and locked away for 17 years. What is with this insistence on military tribunals anyway? For results, there is nothing like a good old-fashioned criminal trial in civilian court. More than 400 men and women charged with terrorism-related crimes have been tried and convicted in civilian court, sentenced to long prison stints and sent off to U.S. penitentiaries on American soil. The precise number of suspected terrorists convicted in military tribunals since the Sept. 11 attacks is three. Lieberman has come up with a drastic solution. Now all he needs is a Constitution that would allow it and, oh yeah, a problem that it would solve. Ann Woolner is a Bloomberg News columnist. ",3
4,"The following editorial appeared in Saturday's Washington Post: Did Alan Simpson's mother never tell him to count to 10 before saying _ or e-mailing _ something he might regret? Apparently not. The Wyoming Republican, a former senator and now co-chair of President Barack Obama's fiscal responsibility commission, put, as he acknowledged, a size 15 foot in his mouth when he wrote to a critic that the Social Security program had become 'like a milk cow with 310 million tits.' Simpson apologized, but his itchy e-mail trigger finger played right into the hands of those who argue that a panel charged with finding ways to control the debt ought not to be mucking around with Social Security. An array of groups, including the Older Women's League, whose director wrote the column that set Simpson off, demanded his firing. The White House said it regretted Simpson's remarks _ we bet it did! _ but that he would remain on the panel. This episode is as unfortunate as it is predictable; Simpson has a penchant for remarks that are colorful bordering on intemperate. But his fundamental point is correct: Social Security is not on a sustainable footing. In his e-mail, Simpson pointed to a presentation by the chief actuary for Social Security, Stephen Goss, showing that by 2037 the program's reserves will have been drained and it will be able to pay only 76 percent of scheduled benefits. 'If you think the statistics on poverty for seniors are alarming _ then you need to read this little pamphlet to know what is really alarming,' Simpson wrote. The most sensible and least painful way to address this problem is to act sooner rather than later to make the relatively modest adjustments that will be needed. These changes should be done in a way that protects the most vulnerable seniors. But dawdling and hoping for better-than-expected economic news is not protecting that needy population. It is taking the risk of steep benefit cuts that would hurt these seniors the most. That is, we think, what Simpson's mother would have wanted him to say. ",2

4,"Winter hunting season is underway for resident Canada geese, abundant, non- native waterfowl that linger year-round. 'For the love of all that is holy, please eat them,' blogs Jackson Landers, a Virginia hunting instructor, author and guide who promotes harvesting invasive species for food. Resident Canada geese 'represent a tremendous amount of underutilized food,' he writes. The big geese are originally from the Midwest but were shipped to the East Coast in the early 1900s by hunters, who tethered them to the ground as lures for smaller migratory geese. 'That ended in 1935, when it became illegal to use live decoys,' says Larry Hindman of the Maryland Department of Natural Resources. The decoy birds were released and soon began their population explosion, grazing on and fouling golf courses and suburban lawns, and damaging turf farms and agricultural fields. To help control a population that is twice as large as wildlife managers would prefer, government agencies have adopted more-liberal hunting guidelines. As a result, the resident goose population has been steadily decreasing in rural areas but continues to increase where hunting is not an option. Anyone on the hunt for geese, whether by bow and arrow, shotgun or even their bare hands, must first attend hunter safety classes and get a hunting license. Buying a killed Canada goose is not an option: Unless it comes from a licensed breeder, the sale of waterfowl is illegal. Urban geese are relatively safe from hunters unless they threaten to collide with aircraft. That's when the feds step in and transform a hazard into a harvest. The Department of Agriculture's Wildlife Services program donates goose carcasses 'to food banks, large animal rescue/ rehabilitation groups and zoos,' says the USDA's Michael Begier. In 2009, the USDA donated more than a ton of goose flesh in the Maryland- Delaware-Washington area, says the USDA's Carol Bannerman. One recipient, the Maryland Food Bank, distributed 325 pounds of ground goose and goose chubs (stew meat) to food pantries and food kitchens across the state. 'It's a wonderful resource for protein,' says the food bank's Nancy Smith. 'We are absolutely thrilled. Not many people donate protein.' Demand is high. 'This is the first time in 32 years that we've seen middle-class families using food pantries,' she says. Goose meat 'flies off the shelves as soon as it's available.' Some people find goose donations unpalatable. Sharon Pawlak, for the Coalition to Prevent the Destruction of Canada Geese, says, 'Donating goose meat to food pantries is nothing more than a public relations ploy to justify the cruel and unnecessary slaughter of so-called nuisance geese.' She also has concerns about feeding potentially toxic meat to people who tend to suffer more health problems than other groups. Eating a goose can pose a health hazard if the bird has been dabbling in polluted waters. Waterfowl can accumulate heavy metals and polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs), especially in their fat. Wisconsin's Department of Natural Resources recommends eating no more than a half-pound of urban goose per week: 'The geese must be trimmed of all fat, either baked or broiled, and no drippings should be used in sauces.' That preparation, the department says, should remove 50 to 80 percent of fat-soluble contaminants. Before releasing goose meat, the USDA tests it for toxins. 'The meat is often distributed widely so that no one family or location would be reliant on this meat,' says Bannerman. Hunters for the Hungry, headquartered in Big Island, Va., doesn't deal with many geese. 'The problem,' spokesman Gary Arrington says, 'is finding processors for the birds. It's just not cost-effective.' But if they do hear of a farmer or golf course with a permit to eliminate a flock, they recommend direct donations to soup kitchens, churches or food pantries that are able to prepare a few freshly killed birds. 'Killing an animal is always a sad thing,' says harvesting advocate Landers, 'but eating it at least gives the act some real point and meaning.'

4,"The prototype of the first computer mouse _ which got its name because of the wire that trailed it _ was invented by Doug Engelbart in 1963. Yes, nearly 50 years ago. But it's only a toddler compared with the keyboard, which is a direct descendant _ via punch-card and teletype technologies _ of the typewriter, patented in 1868 by Christopher Latham Sholes. In other words, it's long past time for a change in the way we interact with the digital devices that have proliferated in our lives. While the keyboard and the mouse have introduced billions of people to the digital experience, they have become antiquated obstacles to the kind of computing that is now emerging. This new computing is immersive, augmented and completely social. As sci-fi movies predicted, our digital devices are poised to become even more ubiquitous. They will surround us, responding to our expressions, emotions and gestures. From wearable devices to sensors that will envelop our world to 3-D screens that will react to us, personal computing is about to get a lot more personal. Internet-based television now in development will recognize a viewer and deliver customized entertainment. And it will do this without the trusty keyboard and mouse.

4,"A British jury has convicted a man who planned to attack people he considered 'non-British' of terrorist offenses. The jury at London's Central Criminal Court found 43-year-old Neil Lewington guilty Wednesday of having explosives with intent to endanger life and preparing for acts of terrorism. Prosecutor Brian Altman told the jury Lewington had extreme views on race and ethnicity and planned to attack 'those he considered non-British.' Lewington was arrested in October after an argument with a train conductor. Police found two firebombs in his bag. At his home, they found a notebook labeled 'Waffen SS U.K. members handbook,' along with bomb-making equipment including electrical timers. Lewington will be sentenced later. ",2
4,"President Obama has called and chatted with Shirley Sherrod. Tom Vilsack and Ben Jealous have issued heartfelt apologies. There is talk of a 'Chardonnay summit' in the Rose Garden. The subtext to all this? Let's wrap up this incident quickly so we can all go on our vacations guilt-free, secure in the knowledge that our 'post-racial society' remains intact. Once again, in the midst of the cacophony, calls abound for a national 'dialogue' on race. Yet our nation cannot muster the patience or stamina to sustain such a discussion beyond a single news cycle. In some ways, Sherrod's tale is a metaphor for this country's aborted efforts to address race. In its entirety, her deeply moving story was about transformation and reconciliation between blacks and whites. It contained the seeds of progress and healing. She spoke of blacks and whites working together to save farms and to end poverty and suffering. But Sherrod, and those listening to her story, could get to her hopeful conclusion only by first wading through painful admissions of racial bias and struggle. Unfortunately, our news and political cycles make it impossible for any of us to stay in a room long enough to reach that transformative moment. At the barest suggestion of race, we line up at opposite corners and start hurling accusations. Attorney General Eric Holder was widely criticized last year for suggesting that we are a 'nation of cowards' when it comes to such discussions. The reaction to his comments is a reminder that we cannot continue to ignore this challenge. Yet Americans refuse to acknowledge that, in today's society, racial attitudes are often complicated, multi-layered and conflicted. Racial inequality is perpetuated less by individuals than by structural racism and implicit bias. Evidence of structural inequality is everywhere: in the grossly disproportionate numbers of young black men and women in prison; in the color of students shunted into remedial and special education tracks; in the stubborn segregation of our neighborhoods and schools; in the lack of recreational and academic opportunities for children of color in poor communities; in the inferior medical treatment that people of color receive; and in the still appallingly small numbers of men and women of color in law firms, corporations and government. It is evident, too, in the history of blatant discrimination against black farmers practiced by the Agricultural Department. But that does not make doctors, nurses, police officers, judges, teachers, lawyers, city planners, admission officers or others prejudiced. Most are well- intentioned professionals who believe themselves to be free of racial bias. From their perspective, it is not easy to connect individual actions and decisions to broader structural conditions and environments built up over decades and even centuries. Implicit bias is a reality we must confront far more openly. A growing mass of compelling research reveals the unconscious racial stereotypes many of us harbor that affect our decisions. Such attitudes do not make us prejudiced; they make us human. Those who take the Implicit Association Test often express shock when results show that their unconscious biases conflict with their explicit egalitarian values and ideals. Nonetheless, white and black test-takers match black faces more quickly than white ones with words representing violent concepts and are more likely to mistake a harmless object for a gun when it is carried by a black person. One study found that the more stereotypically black the features of a criminal defendant, the harsher the sentence he or she is likely to receive. Implicit bias has been shown to factor into hiring decisions and into the quality of health care that individuals receive. Mazharin Banaji and Jerry Kang, leading scholars on implicit bias, h ave noted: 'As disturbing as this evidence is, there is too much of it to be ignored.' The good news is that structures can be dismantled and replaced and unconscious biases can be transformed, as happened to Shirley Sherrod and the family she helped, the Spooners. First, though, they must be acknowledged. We and others researching race and justice are committed to untangling the web of structures, conditions and policies that lead to unequal opportunities. Our nation has to stop denying the complexity of our racial attitudes, history and progress. Let's tone down the rhetoric on all sides, slow down and commit to listening with less judgment and more compassion. If Americans did so, we might find that we share more common ground than we could have imagined. Charles J. Ogletree Jr. is executive director of the Charles Hamilton Houston Institute for Race and Justice and the author most recently of 'The Presumptions of Guilt: The Arrest of Henry Louis Gates, Jr. and Race, Class, and Crime in America.'

4,"Listening to the fiery rhetoric about the mortgage mess emanating from politicians last week, you'd think that big bad banks were trying to foreclose on hundreds of thousands of homeowners who were current on their payments but had become victims of sloppy business practices. If that were the case, declaring a national moratorium on foreclosures would be the just and reasonable thing to do. But if, as appears to be the case, the overwhelming majority of homeowners facing foreclosure have fallen far behind on their payments, then it is a good deal harder to summon up the same moral outrage over reports that the banks and loan service companies cut corners, failed to keep the right documents and engaged in shoddy and even fraudulent practices. Just because the banks and servicers have screwed up doesn't mean they and their investors are no longer entitled to get their money back. Certainly banks and servicers should, at their own expense, be sent back to do things right. Those who engaged in fraud should be punished. And if there are legitimate questions about who owns a loan, those will need to be resolved before the proceeds of any foreclosure are distributed. But none of that changes the basic reality that there are millions of Americans who took out mortgages they could not support on houses they could not afford. It may be necessary to postpone their day of reckoning for a few months to get the paperwork in order and ensure that all the proper procedures are followed, but the reckoning is inevitable. There may be some good that comes out of this mess. Stretching out the foreclosure process would reduce the number of houses dumped on the market over the next six months, which could help firm up housing prices in the short term and put some extra support under a sagging economy. But everyone should understand that the longer the foreclosure process goes on, the longer it will take for the excess supply of houses to be absorbed, for prices to stabilize and for the real estate market to return to something closer to a normal equilibrium. A moratorium should also put pressure on banks and loan servicers to finally bite the bullet, as many of us suggested they do two years ago, and move more aggressively to restructure problem loans by writing off more of the principal and refinancing what remains at lower interest rates over longer terms. The breakdown in the foreclosure system has also exposed serious weaknesses in the way mortgages are written, packaged and serviced that should force the industry to adopt instruments and structures that are simpler and easier to change when things go wrong. Based on the recent revelations, the consumer protection agency should require that mortgage servicers meet minimal standards of customer service and offer clear procedures for loan modification and third- party adjudication before the foreclosure process can be initiated. If this adds to the price of a loan, so be it. That said, those who are cheerleading for a moratorium should realize they can only push things so far. It would not help the recovery of the economy, or the real estate market, if the foreclosure process became so hopelessly tangled that banks and investors effectively lose the ability to recoup the remaining value of their collateral. That would provide some immediate financial relief to households facing foreclosure, but it would encourage many more homeowners to begin shirking their mortgage payments in the belief that they would also be able to avoid the consequences. The long term consequences of that would be that mortgage rates would be higher and mortgage loans would be smaller and harder to get. Perhaps it is only natural for Americans to take some guilty pleasure in watching as the big banks and Wall Street wizards who created this flawed and complex mortgage machine are hoisted on their own petards. But be careful what you wish for. The financial system is still fragile enough that we may not be able to afford a full helping of revenge. ",3
4,"Most of the energy we use in this country comes from sources far beneath the Earth's surface called fossil fuels. Petroleum (which is used to make oil and gasoline), natural gas and coal formed deep underground over hundreds of millions of years. These deposits were created as once-living plants and animals decomposed under high pressure and heat. Humans have created sophisticated ways to get these fuels out of the earth, and they now account for more than 80 percent of all the energy Americans use to heat our homes, cook food and drive our cars. But someday, these deposits of fossil fuels will run out. So experts want to come up with alternative sources of energy that are 'renewable,' which means they won't run out. Here are a couple of interesting renewable energy sources that have been growing quickly. Wind power: Do you remember seeing old grain windmills on a field trip or in storybooks? They used the wind to move giant blades, and as they turned, huge gears inside the windmill operated grain-crushing machinery. Modern windmills, called wind turbines, are used to generate electricity. Rather than turning grain machinery, the gears attached to a wind turbine's rotors move wires inside a magnetic field, which causes an electric charge to form in the wire. Constant movement of these wires creates an electric current that can be used to power homes and businesses. Companies are now building huge wind farms, but they can be placed only in areas that are consistently windy. Wind power now accounts for 1.5 percent of all electricity used around the world, and many more wind farms are planned. Garbage fuel: Most of the trash we throw out ends up in landfills _ huge, rotting piles of garbage. As this waste rots over time, it lets off a gas called methane, which is the main ingredient in natural gas. Companies are building plants that capture the methane from garbage dumps and use it to manufacture natural gas. When chilled to extremely low temperatures, natural gas turns into liquid, which takes up far less space and is easier to move around. In California, the trash collecting company Waste Management has built the largest plant in the world for turning methane from landfills into liquid natural gas. That fuel is then used to power hundreds of the company's garbage trucks. There's another benefit to this technology: Methane contributes to global warming, so this process keeps it from seeping into the atmosphere from the garbage dump. There are more than 500 landfills in the nation trying to recycle waste into energy. It's expensive to do, but experts say it will become cheaper as more companies do it and the technology improves.

4,"For the past year, I've been warning that the imbalances underlying the financial crisis _ the explosive growth of credit, the mispricing of risk, the mispricing of real estate and other assets, the overcapacity in the global economy _ were so huge that a quick and easy economic recovery was highly unlikely. And for much of that time, it has looked as though I was dead wrong. Stocks rebounded, credit markets revived, corporate profits returned and bank balance sheets have been repaired. But the nagging suspicion is that too much of this rebound is the result of the massive fiscal and monetary stimulus that not only did its job of reversing what was a dangerous downward spiral, but also made it possible for many countries to delay dealing with those fundamental economic imbalances. No better proof exists than the financial drama now unfolding in Western Europe, where for many years countries from Ireland to Greece used the financial cover offered by a new continental currency to overspend, overborrow and overexpand. In the case of Greece, the government took on so much debt during the bubble years that there is almost no way out of its predicament. If Athens manages to make good on its promises to cut spending and turn a nation of tax cheats into taxpayers, there's a good chance it will trigger a vicious deflationary spiral _ falling prices, falling employment and falling government revenue _ that will make it impossible to repay debts. Or Greece could renege on its promises and find itself shut off from further borrowing. Either path leads to some sort of default. The story is somewhat different in other countries, albeit with similar consequences. In Spain and Ireland, the problem is not so much government debt but rather all the private debt used to fuel massive real estate bubbles. Now that those bubbles have burst, the banks that lent that money are facing such huge losses that they have had to be bailed out by the government (in the case of Ireland) or may soon have to be (in the case of Spain). And the ensuing recession has now cut so deeply into tax revenue that even the heretofore fiscally responsible governments of these two countries are now finding it difficult and expensive to borrow new money or refinance existing debt when it comes due. Compounding the problem is that much of this troubled debt, both public and private, is now in the hands of Europe's biggest banks, many of which were already too thinly capitalized and weakened by losses from soured U.S. investments. For European leaders, the decision to finally come through with a $145 billion rescue package for Greece represented a calculated decision that it was less painful, financially and politically, to rescue a profligate neighbor than to rescue their own bankers. Indeed, the problem with European leaders' response to this crisis has been that their exaggerated concerns about appearances have led them to reject useful strategies. It was out of concern for appearances that the European Union initially rejected the idea of allowing the International Monetary Fund to offer an early rescue package for Greece, only to finally relent when the run on Greek bonds turned into a rout. It was out of concern for appearances that the European Central Bank announced sternly several weeks back that it would not allow European banks to borrow by using downgraded Greek bonds as collateral, and that it would never use its balance sheet to monetize Greek debt. This week, however, the ECB began accepting Greece's bonds, now junk, as collateral while hinting that it is open to buying even more on the secondary market. It is now with the same misguided determination that some European officials have tried to shut down any discussion of a restructuring of Greece's debt, or that of any other eurozone country, on the theory that a default for one would be a default for them all. In fact, markets are fully capable of distinguishing between the finances of different countries that may use the same currency, just as they can distinguish the bonds of the state of California from those of Utah. And although any country that defaults will surely face the prospect of being shut out of credit markets for years, that punishment is no different than what was meted out in the past to countries such as Greece and Italy, when they were free to escape financial predicaments by repaying their debts in devalued currency. With the Greek credit crisis quickly turning into a eurozone-wide liquidity crisis, European leaders would be well advised to forget about appearances and come up with an acceptable mechanism for the orderly restructuring of sovereign debt. For just as 'too big to fail' has proven a lousy strategy for banks, it is just as lousy when applied to countries, in both cases encouraging incaution on the part of lenders and profligacy and risk-taking on the part of borrowers. While a debt restructuring would be painful for Greece and its European bankers, it would surely be less painful than a decade of austerity-induced recession. And while a Greek default would probably lead to higher borrowing costs for some eurozone neighbors, that's precisely the sort of post-bubble repricing of risk that is necessary to restore confidence in global markets, rebalance the global economy and provide the foundation necessary for sustainable long-term growth.

Spanish media reported that Alguersuari, who was promoted to reserve driver in time for the German race, would replace Bourdais at the Hungarian GP on July 26. Toro Rosso would not comment on the decision. Bourdais said the team hadn't discussed the issue with him over the weekend. ",1
4,"(c) 2010, The Washington Post= WASHINGTON _ Opening your political Washington movie in front of a media- political Washington audience? Pretty much the definition of 'tough crowd.' That was the room that 'Casino Jack' faced Wednesday at an E Street Cinema screening of the Kevin Spacey-as-Jack Abramoff flick, sponsored by the Creative Coalition, with faces like Andrea Mitchell, Jane Harman and Ben Bradlee in the crowd. You didn't have to be a Pulitzer-winning expert on the Byzantine schemes of the disgraced former superlobbyist to wince at the Hollywood embroidery and hyperbole. Rep. Bob Ney getting handcuffed in the halls of Congress? Doesn't work that way. Abramoff's now-defunct Signatures declared 'the best restaurant in town'? Don't recall that. They even botched the cliched insult: It's not 'Washington is Hollywood with ugly faces,' it's 'Washington is Hollywood for ugly people'! Possibly the room's favorite groaner: The rooftop happy hour where a journalist taunts Abramoff for his links to Mariana Islands sweatshops and gets slugged in the face by another lobbyist. Next line: 'You just hit a hemophiliac reporter for The Washington Post!' (We've asked around. Didn't happen. Sorry.) There was just too much, really, and moderator Chris Matthews seemed too weary to take it all on in the post-screening Q&A, so he let Spacey off the hook with mild hazing. 'How'd ya get permission to shoot on the Capitol lawn?' the MSNBC anchor asked. 'That's not allowed. HAH!' 'I think we call it CGI,' the star responded dryly. 'We shot it all in Toronto.' The movie was meant to 'shed a light on a process that is a culture,' said Spacey. 'When we look at the kind of money that needs to be raised for campaigns ... maybe we can make some points about the hypocrisy' and inspire some change. Well, what kind? Spacey suggested that campaign reform could begin by cutting back on costly ads. The networks, he said, could 'decide they could serve the public' by vetting all campaign ads for accuracy, and then 'run them for free.' Huh. 'You've gotten beyond me,' growled Matthews. 'I don't know how to do that. Because of the First Amendment.' The mood was a little flat, as it's reportedly been at many recent 'Casino Jack' unveilings: The director, George Hickenlooper, died suddenly two weeks ago in Denver at age 47. Spacey said he most regretted that Hickenlooper missed screening the movie for a D.C. audience. 'He was finally being recognized as a great filmmaker.' A man in the audience who said he was a friend of Abramoff's applauded Spacey's nuanced portrayal. Abramoff wasn't just a heavy, 'he was dorky,' the friend said. 'He was a dorky guy. I thought you did a fantastic job.' ",1
4,"At the Barnes & Noble in Virginia's Tysons Corner Center, one aisle has a peculiar new configuration. On one side, new current events books about America and its troubles and promise. On the other side, toys: Cook and Play Potsy, My Pal Scout, Ernie Fire Engine. 'I had no idea this was here,' said Charles Davis, an Alexandria resident shopping with his companion, Sabina Sauer. They had stumbled upon the intriguing new world of toy retailing, in which Barnes & Noble, Borders and retailers even less associated with products for little kids - Whole Foods Market, The Vitamin Shoppe - are angling for parental wallets with high-end, mostly educational toys, often with a green component. The new toy hawkers know that children's wares have been an easy path to parents' wallets for eons, particularly during recessions. Older shoppers may recall that the original department stores placed children's items in the very back, so moms had to traverse the entire store, much as many supermarkets stock milk in the rear corner of the store. But in many ways, the latest shift in the $21 billion toy industry represents yet another reordering of the brick-and-mortar world brought on by the digital revolution. The trend toward adding unrelated product lines may seem to fly in the face of the niche marketing that has flourished in the Internet era, but retailers say going broader may be an answer to their woes. The specialty toy industry has contracted significantly in the past decade as big toy chains swallowed smaller independents in a bid to stave off threats from Wal-Mart, Target and Costco. Popular chains such as Zany Brainy and Imaginarium are history. The only stand-alone toy store at Tysons Corner Center is Lego. Toy industry executives say that contraction, along with the heavy influence of Amazon.com - which has shown that a business can establish itself by selling one thing (books) and then add many other products - has given nontraditional toy sellers confidence that putting puzzles, games and other delights on their shelves will not turn off consumers. In fact, the surprise of finding an unexpected toy might be pleasant. About 40 percent of toy purchases aren't planned, according to the NPD Group. That's helped Green Toys Inc. sell lots of tugboats made from recycled plastic at Whole Foods. The company's jump-ropes and tool sets are also sold through EcoShoppe, a green-oriented line of stores operated by The Vitamin Shoppe. 'This is really an extension of what Amazon brought the world,' said Robert von Goeben, who started Green Toys, based in San Francisco, in 2008. 'They moved laterally, and they were very successful at that. Their shoppers got used to finding other items. We now know the Internet is one large buy-everything place, and the bricks and mortars now realize that there are successful lateral moves they can make.' Whole Foods sells puzzles and games by several speciality toymakers in the middle of its supermarkets, in the vitamins and healthy-body section. The toys are eco-friendly and mainly educational, and executives say they are thrilled by the response. 'We gain a lot of customers during big life changes, like pregnancy and childbirth, when people start beginning to be more conscious about what they eat and then moving to organic products,' said Jeremiah McElwee, senior whole body coordinator for Whole Foods. 'We have a very high percentage of mothers and children shopping together in our stores, and we want to be a destination for them. People want to find more variety in that one stop they make.' Booksellers are turning to toys in part because they are finding themselves with extra floor space as their music and movie departments shrink or close entirely, having been significantly disrupted by iTunes and Netflix. Booksellers are also fighting against Kindles and iPads to hold on to book sales. So in the new floor space, booksellers are adding aisles of toys, marketing the new items as related to books because they are educational. Barnes & Noble executives also concede that profits on toys are often better than in other categories. 'The margin for us is not necessarily the motivation, but it has been a benefit of the mix,' said Kathleen Campisano, vice president of toys and games for Barnes & Noble. The chain is now testing going beyond a few aisles, in some stores devoting as much space to toys as to the entire fiction selection. 'How high can we go with this business?' she said. 'How broad can it be? That's what we're trying to figure out.' 'The question really is: What are they going to do when they can't sell books anymore?' said Steven Aarons, president of Barstons Child's Play, a Washington- area chain of five toy stores. 'Are they just going to be a department store?' ",1
4,"Found at World Trade Center ST. LEONARD, Md. _ Once, this was a stout ship, with oak futtocks and floor timbers, fastened with iron nails, built with saw and adz and the calloused hands of shipwrights now long dead. Two centuries ago, it was a simple coaster, hauling goods around the Eastern capes, armed against pirates, and ending its days at a wharf in New York City. As the years went by, it sank into the harbor mud, entombed beneath what would one day become the World Trade Center site. Shortly after noon Monday, two trucks bearing the ship's unearthed skeleton pulled into a Maryland science complex on the shore of the Patuxent River in St. Leonard, where scores of eager archaeologists and curators waited as if for the bones of a dinosaur. There, over the next few hours, workers in lab coats and T-shirts unloaded the pieces one at a time, arrayed most of them on tarps and with hose and sponge, toothbrush and bare hands scrubbed away the muck of 200 years. And there, over the next few weeks, scientists hope to discover when the ship was built, where it traveled, exactly how big it was and more about the bygone world in which it sailed. The ship was discovered in New York on July 12 when its ribs were spotted poking out of the muck as workers were excavating the World Trade Center site. Last week, the pieces were catalogued and removed by a team that included staff from Maryland's state archaeological conservation laboratory, which specializes in such work. It's not clear how the ship got buried beneath the twin towers, which were destroyed in the Sept. 11, 2001, terrorist attacks. It could have been used as fill when the Manhattan shoreline was expanded into the Hudson River about 1800, curators say. Sections of San Francisco are built on fill partly made of old ships, said Betty Seifert, a curator at the laboratory. Or the vessel might have sunk at its wharf and been forgotten. Ships 'get old, they get tired, they get tied in and left and abandoned,' Seifert said. And it's not clear what kind of ship it is. 'Never seen anything exactly like this,' said Warren Riess, professor of maritime history and archaeology at the University of Maine and lead investigator on the discovery. 'I'm thinking still that it's about the right size and construction to be what would have been called a coaster,' he said this week as he watched the timbers being unloaded. 'A ship that went down the coast from New York to maybe Maryland, Virginia, Barbados, Boston ... carrying everyday cargo.' The vessel was probably about 6o or 70 feet long and about 18 feet wide, he said. It probably had one or two masts, was a sloop or a brig, and sailed in the late 1700s and early 1800s, he said. The square iron nails in the wood, rather than wooden pegs or 'trunnels,' indicate a later vintage, Riess said. 'Almost the whole thing is tied together with big iron nails.' He said it's not known where the ship was built, although tree scientists are being called in to see whether they can figure out where its wood came from and how old it is. Other scientists might be able to trace where the vessel had been by studying the tiny shells left behind by geographically specific ship worms that ate into the wood, he said. 'It's a mystery,' Riess said. 'It's like a detective story.' (Optional add end) He said that in the bowels of the vessel, workers found, among other things, a well-used bowl of a clay smoking pipe that was probably lost by one of the ship builders. Also found was some buckshot, musket balls and a small cannonball, perhaps from a swivel gun, indicating that the ship was most likely armed against pirates, some of whom lurked in the New Jersey marshlands, he said. Many of the surviving pieces of the ship were 'futtocks' _ curved parts of the frame that were cut from specially selected curved tree limbs, Riess said. Almost all the wood was oak. Also recovered was inner and outer planking, part of the keel and a single, 530-pound piece that was part of either the ship's bow or stern. That had to be lifted from a truck bed with a power hoist. 'Good, solid wood,' Riess said. 'Remember, these ships (had) no radio, they can't call for help, they don't know where they are,' he said. 'If they see a storm coming, they can't run from it. Even a hurricane. ... They've got to make it through on their own ... lives (of the crew) really depended on the ships.' ",1

4,"Back when singer-songwriter John Hiatt was passing through towns in the early '80s, cracking wise on small club tours, the last thing fans wanted to see were signs that he was growing up. In some ways, that still holds true. Of course, Hiatt has become one of the most highly acclaimed and widely covered tunesmiths in pop, but success hasn't dulled his wit or cooled his rock and blues passions. On his new album, 'The Open Road,' Hiatt combines vivid lyrics with the thumping rhythms that stirred his Indiana adolescence. With a blast of guitar distortion and ghostly harmonies, the title and opening cut introduces a Southern gothic tale that comes into focus instantly ('Shrunken head and Mardi Gras beads/ Hanging on a rearview mirror that bleeds'). Then comes 'Haulin',' a free-spirited travelogue reminiscent of Chuck Berry's 'Promised Land,' followed by 'Like a Freight Train' and 'My Baby,' a pair of slide guitar blues songs that are by turns haunting and boisterous. The album's most memorable lyric, however, is also the most ominous. 'What Kind of Man' is a noirish portrait of duplicity: 'You see the man who loves you/ You see the man you love/ But I have hidden claws/ Inside these gloves.' Restlessness, in one form or another, inspires the album's best tunes, as does a band that amplifies Hiatt's personality and soul. Grown up? Fired up is more like it. ",1
4,"Prague zoo says one of its fearless honey badgers is on the run. Zoo spokeswoman Jana Ptacinska Jiratova says the female honey badger named Kaca escaped last week, when she probably climbed over a 1.6-meter (5.25-foot) high fence. Pavel Brandl, in charge of mammals at the Prague zoo, says the honey badger is considered the most fearless animal in the world. He fears that the small, furry carnivore that loves honey is unlikely to survive in the wild. Jiratova says the zoo has received a number of tips from Prague citizens about Kaca's possible whereabouts, but so far the search has been fruitless. Prague zoo is one of the few in the world where six honey badgers were born in captivity. The 10-year-old Kaca, who joined her partner Cert in Prague nine years ago, is the mother to all of them. ",1
4,"Two months after Craigslist promised to rid itself of advertisements placed by prostitutes, law enforcement officials say the online classified ad site is still in the business of selling sex. From a sheriff who has no intention of dropping his lawsuit to an attorney general who suggests that he and colleagues could further pressure the company to crack down on online prostitution, they say they are not through with Craigslist. 'It makes me wonder, do they really think I'm sort of stupid, some bobblehead who will think they changed it?' said Cook County Sheriff Tom Dart, who sued the San Francisco-based company earlier this year, calling it the nation's largest source of prostitution. 'They seem to insist on being cute and playing games (and) it's getting old.' Dart and others acknowledge that when the popular site pulled the plug on its 'erotic services' category and replaced it with a new 'adult services' section, it did away with the most graphic photographs. But they say there is no mistaking that sex is still being sold on the site. Ad after ad include photographs of scantily clad women in suggestive poses. Many offer massages or undefined services -- 'Just imagine what we could do,' reads one; 'Your wife or girlfriend won't do this for you, but we will,' reads another -- with listing prices that vary depending on how much time is required. In an e-mail, Craigslist CEO Jim Buckmaster dismissed Dart's lawsuit as a publicity stunt. 'The citizens of Cook County would arguably be better served if their sheriff spent his time addressing actual crime, rather than using the courts to generate personal publicity,' he wrote. Craigslist announced the changes in May amid mounting criticism of the ads and pressure to do something about them, which grew when a Boston-area area man was accused of fatally shooting a woman who placed an ad on the site. In addition to eliminating the 'erotic services' category, Craigslist promised to pre-screen all submissions to the new section and charge a fee. At the time, Dart's attorney said Craigslist's attorney told him the changes would render the lawsuit unnecessary and suggested Dart drop it. But there were questions then about the new category and how Craigslist would monitor it before allowing ads to be posted. Attorneys general said Craigslist had broken previous promises to monitor erotic ads. 'They are so thinly disguised, the real question is how they are permitted to be there if, in fact, the site is doing the screening and policing that they said they will do,' Connecticut Attorney General Richard Blumenthal said. Dan Gallagher, Dart's attorney in his lawsuit, said it is impossible to read many of the ads without concluding they are solicitations for prostitution -- such as ones he's seen from women who offer escort services for as little as 15 minutes. 'They (Craigslist) go to great lengths to say this is just a site so that people can meet one another to fulfill their romantic aspirations,' he said. 'I don't think having an escort for 15 minutes is a fulfillment of romantic aspirations.' Not only that, Gallagher said, the ads are becoming more obvious prostitution solicitations than they were even before 'adult services' replaced 'erotic services.' He said the euphemism for payment with phrases such as '150 roses' or '200 diamonds' that detectives monitoring the site once saw are disappearing. Now, he said, 'they give the price,' adding that dollar signs are increasingly popping up. Law enforcement officials say they have not received information about the Craigslist monitors, including how many there are, their qualifications and what type of ads they refuse to post. 'It's painfully obvious they're just blowing me off, humoring me,' said Dart, adding that Craigslist hasn't responded to his requests for information. Blumenthal said Craigslist has responded to his requests, and while he won't say what the company has told him, he said he is still waiting for answers to many of the same questions as Dart. 'At the very least what we want to know what is the list of prohibited terms, what are their criteria and procedures,' he said. 'If they need it, we will give them a list of terms.' Blumenthal said a coalition of 40 attorneys general was considering its options and could announce its next move by next week. As for Dart, his detectives are conducting sting operations and making arrests. ",1
4,"Officials have lowered the number of fatalities in Monday's Washington subway system accident to seven, instead of the nine reported earlier. Mayor Adrian Fenty said officials are 'going to let the investigation run its course' and said that hopefully the number will not exceed seven by the end of the day. Fenty also said that two in the accident remain in critical condition in area hospitals. He said he has been told that their conditions are stable. The accident in Monday's rush hour on the Red Line of the Metro system was the worst in the 33-year history of the subway system in the U.S. capital city. ",1
4,"Since the uncomfortably close attempted attack on Northwest Flight 253 last week, many have focused on why the alleged terrorist, Umar Farouk Abdulmutallab, was not placed on a watch list that would have prevented him from flying, even though the government had received information that he was a potential extremist. We should focus on a more fundamental question: How can we keep explosive materials off planes? Most airport security checkpoints use metal detectors. Al-Qaida has shown that it knows how to avoid detection by using an explosive device that contains little or no metal, such as PETN, or pentaerythritol tetranitrate, used by Abdulmutallab and 'shoe bomber' Richard Reid in 2001. During my time as secretary of homeland security, the Transportation Security Administration began working to replace the 1970s-era metal detectors used at airports across America with modern technology able to detect non-metal weapons concealed by terrorists on their bodies _ even in their underwear, where Abdulmutallab allegedly hid his bomb. The latest versions of these machines _ sometimes called whole-body imagers _ are deployed at 19 airports, and the TSA is attempting to place them throughout the nation. From the onset, deployment of the machines has been vigorously opposed by some groups. In June, the House of Representatives passed a bill that would prevent the TSA from using the new systems in most cases. If the House bill were to become law, the TSA would be limited to using the new technology only after a passenger had been selected for additional scrutiny. The vast majority of passengers would still pass only through metal detectors. So, under the standards set by the House bill, a terrorist not on a 'no-fly' list or a watch list mandating closer scrutiny _ like Abdulmutallab _ could probably carry a concealed non-metal weapon onto a plane undetected. Congress should reject this restrictive bill and instead fund a large-scale deployment of next-generation systems. Opposition to whole-body imagers essentially relies on three arguments. First, the American Civil Liberties Union and privacy advocates have complained that the machines subject passengers to a 'virtual strip search.' Second, they claim that the machines are unsafe because they expose passengers to dangerous amounts of radiation in screening. Third, some critics argue that the only correct approach to airline security lies in better intelligence. All of these objections lack merit. The 'safety' concern is particularly specious, because the technologies expose people to no more radiation than is experienced in daily life. The case of Abdulmutallab shows that we cannot simply 'rely on intelligence.' Abdulmutallab was not on a watch list that required closer scrutiny. Even if the review President Obama has ordered closes a gap that would have put Abdulmutallab or others on more select watch lists, there are plenty of terrorists out there about whom we know nothing. Too many potentially dangerous people simply would not appear on any watch list. We cannot put all our eggs in the 'intelligence basket.' That's why, since Sept. 11, 2001, we have worked to establish multiple layers of defense to protect the American people. Watch lists surely are an important layer, as is intelligence-sharing, but others, such as the deployment of advanced detection technology, are just as important. Claims that the screening amounts to 'virtual strip searches' is calculated to alarm the public. As if screening is meant to reveal people's private parts to TSA officers. But the agency has nonetheless taken privacy concerns seriously in creating procedures for using this technology. In deploying the machines, the TSA has strictly limited the number of officers who see the images; separates the officers looking at images from the passengers being screened (so the officers do not know which passengers the images belong to); and uses software to blur the faces on the images _ further protecting the anonymity of passengers. Moreover, the machines are configured to prevent TSA officers from storing or retaining any images. As an additional measure, passengers can choose not to walk through one of the machines and receive a physical examination instead. In short, the TSA has listened to the reasonable concerns of privacy advocates and incorporated numerous suggestions into its protocols to draw the right balance between security and privacy. The administration must stand firm against privacy ideologues, for whom every security measure is unacceptable. Failing to use all available tools to plug a gap in security puts the lives of airline travelers needlessly at risk.

4,"The next time you grab a sheet of paper to do your homework, remember that the product you're writing on was once a tree. Most kids know this, but what you may not know is how a tree is turned into paper. Trees are made of cellulose fibers, organic compounds and a natural glue-like substance called lignin that holds everything together. Cellulose makes up about half of a tree and is used to make paper. But first you need to separate cellulose from other wood parts. Paper mills get their wood from two sources: small trees that are harvested for paper and scraps from larger trees that were sent to sawmills for lumber. The bark is stripped off, and trees are put through a chipper, which makes it easier to process. Once the wood has been chipped, it's converted to wood pulp. Pulping requires a combination of steam, pressure, chemicals, grinders and in some cases, bleach. Unbleached pulp becomes bags and boxes. Bleached pulp is turned into paper for writing or printing. (Bleached wood pulp is gooey and white _ like mashed potatoes, without the yummy taste.) When the pulp is finished, it's mixed with water and sprayed onto large, moving screens. The water drains through the screens, and that lets the cellulose fibers stick together to make paper. The paper moves at high speeds through a series of presses and driers. Additives strengthen the paper. Finally, the finished paper is wound on rolls and cut to size. Now that you know the basics of making paper, I have a question for you. True or false? You can buy paper that's made from elephant poop. True. Depending on the season, an elephant's diet consists of grass, leaves, twigs, bark, vines, roots, flowers and even fruit. However, since vegetation can be difficult to digest, lots of plant fiber comes out of the elephant's body without being broken down. By cleaning and removing the waste from undigested plant matter, you can harvest enough cellulose to make paper. Thanks to the enterprising minds of eco-friendly folks, you can buy paper made from the poop of pandas, kangaroos, sheep, bison and reindeer. Do you think any of your friends might like some as a birthday present? - - - Bennett is a Washington pediatrician and author of health-related books for kids. ",1
4,"Washington area boozers were breathing a bit easier this week following news reports that an audit by the Washington Metropolitan Police Department found some 80 percent of its 'breathalyzer' alcohol monitors may have been giving faulty readings. The impact on current and past DUI cases is uncertain. But one thing is for sure: Breath analysis devices are society's front-line weapon against drunken driving, and they need to be unassailably accurate. Many well-calibrated units are, and the technology has improved dramatically since the original 'drunkometer' made its highway debut in 1938. But even today's most impressive devices may soon seem downright primitive, thanks to relentless progress in microsensor science. In the fast-growing, fast- shrinking field of single-molecule detection, some gizmos are now able to spot substances in the parts-per-trillion range. Sensors known as 'e-noses' function as artificial snouts that can identify the barest trace of compounds in the air, while microfluidic 'lab on a chip' sensors can flag individual DNA strands and other entities in liquids. Few of them are commercialized as yet. But the trend portends a revolution in public safety, according to Stephen Semancik, who heads the Chemical Microsensor Program at the National Institute of Standards and Technology. 'What we can't smell can hurt us,' he says, citing dangers from carbon monoxide to spoiled food, low-level industrial toxins, water contaminants and building fires where 'five minutes can be life or death.' The smaller the amount you can detect, the earlier your warning. For example, to be perfectly morbid, in the event that terrorists use chemical weapons, you really don't want to wait until concentrations reach levels at which your commuter train seatmate says, 'Hey, what's that funny odor?' At that point, even if you just got on the train, you're probably at the end of the line. In medical applications, Semancik says, 'smelling other kinds of molecules might be able to help us in early disease detection.' He foresees breath-type detectors deployed to detect a host of maladies, including skin cancer (recognizable now by trained dogs), diabetes (whose sufferers exhale a telltale scent of acetone, the working ingredient in nail-polish remover) and cystic fibrosis (where breath is abnormally acidic and rich in sulfur compounds). If sniffer diagnostics could be used for initial screening in lieu of a battery of expensive and invasive tests, both patients and the health-care system would benefit. Whatever their uses, the next microsensors will be small, highly automated and sufficiently sensitive to operate in the chemical cacophony of the real world. There are numerous designs. In a typical mechanical system, airborne molecules stick to the end of a microscopic cantilever. Just as a diving board vibrates differently if it's occupied by your 6 year old or your double-wide neighbor, the vibrational frequency of the tiny cantilever changes in response to the mass of the molecule trapped on it and sounds the alarm when its target compound shows up. Other mechanical systems use nanoscale tubes (that is, with dimensions in the range of billionths of a meter) to snag pathogens by size. For example, University of Missouri scientists recently created a glass 'nanopore' system custom-tailored to trap single molecules of ricin, a nasty little poison extracted from castor beans. Optical systems sense changes in the properties of transmitted or reflected light that occur when the molecule of interest binds to another molecule or undergoes a chemical reaction. David Walt of Tufts University devised a novel variation: 'My lab recently demonstrated that we could isolate single molecules into very tiny wells etched into the end of a fiber optic bundle,' Walt said in an e-mail. The bundle had tens of thousands of such wells, each just big enough for one target DNA molecule coated with special compounds that would react with the DNA to produce fluorescence. When a solution containing the molecules flowed across the bundle, wells that trapped the molecules lit up. Counting the ratio of dark to light fibers in the bundle, Walt's team was able to determine the concentration of molecules in the solution to unprecedented accuracy. But the ultimate goal is to get out of the lab. 'I believe that the focus of this field is moving from `sensors' to `point of care technologies' (POCT) that bring bioanalytic methods from the laboratory to the point of need, whether it is the bedside, emergency room or for preventative medicine such as cholesterol monitoring,' Jerome Schultz, chair of the Department of Bioengineering at the University of California at Riverside, said in an e-mail. 'This type of device would have wide applications for water quality, especially for third world countries, food contamination and bioterrorism.' If such sensors can be made sufficiently small, sensitive and cheap, the public could become a giant roving detection system. 'We all have cellphones now,' Semancik says. 'Suppose we put a chemical sensor in every phone?' If it encountered a threat, it would send out a signal. If the monitoring system started getting lots of the same signals from one place (as determined by the phones' GPS locators), responders could home in on the threat. Boozers, beware. Before you know it, the old cliche will become the new reality: They can smell you coming a mile away. ",3
4,"You've got to give the girl credit. In an age of communication dominated by e-mail, texting and tweets, the 24-year-old actress Amanda Seyfried _ star of 'Dear John' and now 'Letters to Juliet' _ seems to be on a one-woman quest to revive the lost art of letter writing. But if putting pen to paper is as much of a chore as watching her new movie, the stationery industry is doomed. In 'Letters,' Seyfried plays Sophie, a fact checker for the New Yorker who dreams of becoming a writer. While vacationing in Verona, Italy, she wanders into the House of Juliet, a place where, according to custom, the lovelorn leave letters seeking romantic advice from Shakespeare's tragic heroine. Not that she's any kind of authority on the subject, and anyway, she's fictional. But never mind. A colorful group of older female volunteers answers every one. Although Sophie hasn't figured it out yet, she herself is among the heartbroken. Her fiance, Victor (Gael Garc a Bernal), with whom she's traveling, just isn't that into her. A self-absorbed chef, he seems to be more in love with whatever bit of pasta, pastry, olive oil or wine he has just popped into his mouth. With a look Sophie wishes he'd reserve for her, Victor goes through the movie pronouncing everything edible 'amazing' or 'incredible.' (Really, the guy could use a couple of new adjectives. I lost track after a dozen instances of each.) Left on her own, Sophie naturally gravitates to the Miss Lonelyhearts at the House of Juliet, who take her under their nurturing wings. But not as a client. After Sophie finds an old letter written by a British teenager named Claire who'd fallen in love with and then left an Italian boy named Lorenzo Bartolini _ a letter written in 1957, but never answered _ Sophie takes it upon herself to compose a reply. The gist of it is this: When it comes to love, it's never too late. That's not advice; that's a fortune cookie. The next thing we know, Claire (Vanessa Redgrave), now a senior citizen, has shown up with her handsome but surly grandson Charlie (Christopher Egan), in search of the lost Lorenzo. Against Charlie's better instincts _ he thinks the whole thing is a dumb idea _ Sophie tags along as navigator and chronicler of the search. Although Charlie and Sophie bicker insufferably at first, they will soon be canoodling. The screenwriters having decided, in their infinite matchmaking wisdom, that it makes sense to substitute one good-looking jerk for another. It doesn't. Some mild humor results from the fact that Lorenzo Bartolini is a popular Italian name. There's even a famous 19th-century sculptor with that name. Without spoiling things, it can be said that Franco Nero plays the grown-up Lorenzo in question and that the Italian actor is married to Redgrave in real life. The couple, who wed in 2006, reunited in storybook fashion after a separation of 36 years, following an affair that began on the set of 'Camelot' and produced a son. Perhaps you see where all this is going. If not, it's all there in the trailer.

4,"The same day Nevada Republican Sharron Angle announced her candidacy for Harry Reid's Senate seat in 2009, she agreed with a conservative radio host who claimed that there are 'domestic enemies' and 'homegrown enemies' in Congress. That's right: The GOP candidate in what is arguably the highest-profile Senate race in the country said 'Yes, I think you're right,' to the suggestion that there are enemies of our country within the 'walls of the Senate and the Congress.' Angle has been asked about this at least three times, and each time she has refused to change her position. On Monday, when ABC News' Jonathan Karl asked whether she stood by the claim, she replied: 'Certainly people who pass these kinds of policies _ Obamacare, cap and trade, stimulus, bailout _ they're certainly not friends to the free-market system.' Karl: 'So, what are they?' Angle: 'They're not friends.' This isn't complicated. All Angle has to say is: No, of course I don't believe there are domestic enemies in Congress. Given some of Angle's other statements, particularly her suggestion that people may resort to 'Second Amendment remedies' if Congress continues on its current course, it seems possible that she may well believe there are 'domestic enemies' in Congress. If a high-profile Democratic Senate candidate agreed with a lefty host's claim that conservatives within Congress constitute 'domestic enemies' _ and then repeatedly refused to disavow the claim when given the chance _ it would be picked up by scores of major media outlets and hammered at ceaselessly until the claim was retracted. But Angle is mostly getting a pass. Have journalists decided that Angle's eccentric comments have raised the bar so high this latest is no longer worthy of attention?

4,"There's a reason films like 'Ran' get 25th-anniversary rereleases. It's because there aren't a heck of a lot of them. Based on Shakespeare's 'King Lear' and set in 16th-century feudal Japan, Akira Kurosawa's 1985 antiwar epic is almost over the top with betrayal, battle and blood. At times, the red stuff flows like paint from the brush of Jackson Pollock. It's an angry and expressive spurt of pigment, emblematic of the director's rage _ the title is the Japanese character for 'chaos' or 'fury' _ and not a realistic body fluid. Filmgoers raised on contemporary special effects might balk at all the fake- looking gore, along with the Noh-style old-age makeup of the main character, Lord Hidetora Ichimonji (Tatsuya Nakadai), whose actions set the story in motion. But the drama itself packs a powerful _ and timeless _ gut punch. As in 'Lear,' Hidetora has decided to divide his kingdom among his three children, except here they're sons instead of daughters. The eldest two, Taro (Akira Terao) and Jiro (Jinpachi Nezu), flatter their father, while the youngest, Saburo (Daisuke Ryu), calls the old man a fool for thinking that Taro and Jiro won't quickly turn their backs on their father. Saburo, like Shakespeare's Cordelia, is banished for his blunt talk. Of course, Taro and Jiro almost immediately let Hidetora down. It is at this point that Kurosawa goes well beyond his source material, adding a treacherous female character in the form of Taro's wife, Kaede (Mieko Harada). Like Lady Macbeth, she's the real instigator of Taro and Jiro's perfidy, and her presence lends the film a Grand Guignol flair. At one point she demands the head of her sister-in-law after her own husband is killed and she has seduced Jiro. It's wild, compulsively watchable stuff. But Kurosawa doesn't care just about 'how sharper than a serpent's tooth it is to have a thankless child.' Over the course of the film's nearly three-hour length, Hidetora is shown to be something of a war criminal himself. He didn't just inherit his kingdom but shed 50 years' worth of his neighbors' blood to get it and keep it. His betrayal by his sons makes him a tragic figure, but so does the blood on his own hands. By the time Kurosawa's camera comes to rest on the film's final, poignant image, a painting of the Buddha that one character had promised another would protect him from harm, the movie seemingly has accomplished the impossible: one-upping Shakespeare. R. Contains lots of blood and violence, and brief sensuality. In Japanese with English subtitles. 162 minutes. ",1
4,"The Seattle City Attorney's Office has decided not to press charges against Microsoft founder Bill Gates' father after the community leader apologized for a hit-and-run collision and paid for damages. According to documents obtained by KIRO-TV, the incident happened in August. Investigators say they found Bill Gates Sr.'s Mercedes near Seattle Center, wedged against another car, with the engine running and the keys in the ignition. The police report says the owner of the other car called police and Gates' vehicle was towed. When he and a friend returned, the 84-year-old Gates was given a citation for a hit-and-run incident. No one was injured in the incident. Gates' friend said at the time that Gates may have had a 'senior moment' and didn't know he was so close to the other vehicle.

4,"Jenny Potter is reveling in the little delights of her fourth trip to the Olympics, from new jerseys and fresh ice sheets to the daily teasing from U.S. women's hockey teammates who call her Potsy or Mom. That perspective is always on the 31-year-old Potter's mind after the changes in her life since the last games. Her husband and two children will be in Vancouver to cheer the Americans' run at another gold medal, but her mother won't be in the seats Potter's family bought for her just a few months ago. 'With my mom passing away, it's become more about how you live your life,' Potter said Thursday. 'I'm enjoying everything about this experience. It's just about living life to the fullest and working hard each day, and then spending time with your family and being grateful.' Potter, the only mother on the U.S. team, has been playing international hockey since 1997, yet her decade-long balance between family and hockey is almost as impressive as her wrist shot. She took one winter off for the birth of her now-9-year-old daughter, Maddy, but returned a year later for the Salt Lake Olympics. Six years after that, she played into the fifth month of her pregnancy with her now-3-year-old son Cullen -- and she returned for the 2007 world championships just three months after giving birth. Potter's husband, Rob, is a high school coach and together they also run a hockey school in Minnesota. With help from family and friends, they manage to juggle their hectic schedule -- but the sudden loss of Potter's mother added a bittersweet element to this Olympic run. Terri Schmidgall died at 57 on Nov. 20 from a persistent form of melanoma, which returned aggressively several months ago. Just 11 days earlier, Potter's grandmother also died at 89. 'When she was going through that, it was going through the team,' U.S. coach Mark Johnson said. 'It was hard, especially for the kids that are close to Jenny. It was tough on Jenny, and she persevered. She has grown from it.' Potter is the Americans' oldest player, one year older than fellow four-time Olympic defenseman Angela Ruggiero -- and her teammates make sure she remembers it. Potter relishes the jabs, yet she's also embracing her role as a teacher and a more vocal leader for young teammates who grew up idolizing speedy little Jenny Schmidgall in the Nagano Games. 'I grew up in a different era, playing against boys and learning the fundamentals,' Potter said. 'Today, it's all about breakaways and having a good move in the shootout. What I've tried to tell some of the younger players is how I pride myself on conditioning and work ethic. If you're willing to keep working hard all the time, you're going to get better.' Potter spent the past two summers training with Hilary Knight, who emerged as the U.S. team's surprise leading scorer during the months leading up to the Olympics. Knight and 20-year-old twins Jocelyne and Monique Lamoureux all look up to Potter for both her skill and maturity. 'Potsy has been great to us since we met her,' Jocelyne Lamoureux said. 'We remember all the way back to Nagano, seeing hockey on television and thinking it was great. Now we get the chance to play with her. It's pretty amazing.' ",1

4,"Glenn Beck fans are not going to like our colleague Dana Milbank's new book about the tea party favorite, 'Tears of a Clown.' Little reason they should, since the book is a 257-page skewering. But for those who don't watch Beck regularly, or have never even seen his Fox News show, the book is a look - albeit sharply negative - at the meteoric rise of someone who's developed a massive following of millions of viewers and devotees. With his show and his best-selling books, Beck, just coming off that huge rally on the Mall, is undeniably one of the most influential people in America today. So attention must be paid. Milbank concludes that 'the fury, the violent talk, the shouting - in short the craziness' on television are 'all for show.' Indeed, the opening chapter finds Beck in a photo shoot at which the makeup woman is rubbing menthol under his eyes to induce that famous crying. But surely Beck, despite estimated revenue of around $30 million a year, is a very worried man. 'If you paid attention,' as songwriter Randy Newman sings, 'you'd be worried, too.' And Beck is very worried - in a panic, in fact - about most everything, Milbank writes: Nazis, commies, President Obama, all manner of conspiracies, the collapse of the economy, and especially Woodrow Wilson, president during the progressive era, who left office 90 years ago. Beck blames Wilson for most of today's problems. (Kind of like the way ultra-liberals fixate on the last Whig president, Millard Fillmore.) Most of all, Beck worries that the end, doomsday, is coming, soon, and it won't be pretty. (Which is why he opposes Obama spending on infrastructure projects. After all, why bother?) His worries about a violent national collapse have even attracted survivalist advertisers on the show. One of them touts a 'Survival Seed Bank,' in case 'the politicians and the bankers . . . bring the whole thing crashing down.' 'In an economic meltdown,' the commercial says, 'non-hybrid seeds could become more valuable than even silver and gold.' So, for just $149, plus '$15 for shipping and handling,' you'll get the 'ultimate barter item,' the 'perfect mix of germination-tested non-hybrid seeds,' enough 'to plant a full-acre crisis garden.' Best of all, the 'indestructible survival seed bank can be buried to avoid confiscation.' Tune in or record the show, which airs weekdays at 5 p.m. EDT on the Fox News Channel. Then maybe you'll be worried, too. ",3
4,"In light of lawsuits in which denture users claim they've been harmed by the zinc in their denture adhesive, GlaxoSmithKline has pledged to remove the mineral from its Poligrip products, even as the company maintains that they are safe when used as directed. Procter & Gamble, maker of Poligrip's major rival, Fixodent, says no changes are planned for its product, which it says contains much less zinc than Glaxo's does. Zinc is used to help strengthen the bond between dentures and gums. But many people have claimed that they've suffered neurological damage leading to numbness, partial paralysis and, in one case, death, as a result of using denture adhesives. Dietary zinc _ prime sources include meat, poultry, beans, nuts and oysters _ is good for people, to a point. It bolsters the immune system and promotes wound healing, among other benefits. But too much zinc has long been known to cause neurological problems. Researchers reporting in the journal Annals of Neurology in 2008 found a link between the zinc in denture creams and serious neurologic disease in cases of 'chronic excessive use' of those creams. According to the American Dental Association, well-fitted dentures should need just a tad, if any, adhesive to keep them in place. If you find you need more, have your dentures adjusted or replaced.

4,"For a few hours Sunday night, Audie Crochet's living room became a church. The plush green carpet supported a white pulpit. A suede sofa set and fold-out chairs served as pews. And a 52-inch television thumped out religious-themed music with the power of a full choir. 'Let's pray to God to stick his finger in that plug,' Crochet, 53, said, his body swaying back and forth. 'Yes,' Jason Ross, 37, echoed. 'Plug it.' A day after it was announced that BP's 'top kill' effort had failed, making this gulf-dependent region feel even more helpless, many residents did the only thing they knew to do: pray. They prayed at the Catholic church on Grand Isle. 'Know you are not alone facing the horrible oil spill disaster,' reads a line from the church bulletin. The Rev. Mike Tran's sermon Sunday addressed the oil spill, and the Mass intentions for Monday and Tuesday were to be dedicated to it as well. The floor of the entrance to the church bears four images: a boat, an oil rig, a fish and a bird. They prayed at the Baptist church up the road. 'It's a slow disaster,' said Nathan Stanford, the youth minister. 'We've been praying, but we don't know what to pray for specifically.' They don't know what the final toll will be or whom it will most affect, he said. They, like other congregations, are preparing to give out financial help to residents as needs arise. And they prayed in homes like the one Crochet and his wife bought in a working- class neighborhood in Cut Off. The couple moved there from Grand Isle with their son, John, just before Hurricane Katrina hit. On a wall above the fireplace are three stones, each with a single word: Faith. Hope. Love. Nine people gathered in the living room Sunday night to sing together and hear Crochet, a security guard and real estate agent, give a sermon. The theme that night: Good can come of a crisis. 'It seems like we've been in crisis after crisis after crisis,' said Crochet, who wore a New Orleans Saints championship T-shirt. 'Seems like no sooner we get done with one, another comes up.' The good: Crisis forces innovation and creativity, he said. It tests one's faith, one's strength. It pushes people to surpass their previous limits. It creates leaders. 'I tell you, whoever comes up with the fix to plug this thing, they're going to be patted on the back for years,' Crochet said. 'BP won't have enough money to give them.' 'Let me tell you,' he said. 'Everyone in this room has potential. We do.' Among those in the room were a butcher, two Wal-Mart employees, a security guard and two adults with disabilities unable to work. When the music boomed through the room, the butcher, David Felarise, 50, closed his eyes to sing. The elder Wal-Mart employee, Hilda Ross, 66, threw her arms outward. And Crochet's wife, Rebecca, 55, put one hand on the pulpit and tapped a foot to the ground. Audie Crochet's voice was the loudest. He sang: 'I am pressed but not crushed. I am persecuted but not abandoned. I am struck but not destroyed.' 'Did you see that sign: `God help us all'?' Heather Norwood, 18, the other Wal- Mart employee, said after the singing and sermon were done. She was referring to a figure on the side of the road wearing a gas mask and holding a fish in one hand and the sign in the other. 'In order for that to come true, you have to believe it.' ",1
4,"As early as Monday, the signs were not looking good. The National Zoo's female giant panda, Mei Xiang, was exhibiting some behaviors of pregnancy, but not all of them. The ultrasound scans of her uterus were inconclusive. And the level of certain hormones in her body were saying that her annual pregnancy cycle was over. Plus, there was no cub. The zoo announced Wednesday that, taking all factors into consideration, their panda was once again not pregnant. The conclusion was reached, the zoo said, after experts studied the array of physical, behavioral and chemical clues. 'Based on current hormone analyses, and not having seen a fetus during the ultrasound exams, Zoo researchers have determined that Mei Xiang experienced a pseudopregnancy,' the zoo said in a statement. The zoo had placed the panda on 24-hour pregnancy watch Friday, and officials had high hopes that Mei Xiang might be pregnant. She was artificially inseminated twice in January. 'This is very disappointing news, as you can imagine,' Dr. Janine Brown, head of the zoo's endocrinology lab, said in an e-mail. 'Everyone puts their heart and soul into the reproductive management of these and other species,' she said. 'We had no reason to believe Mei's last artificial insemination would not be successful, but as so often happens, nature had other ideas.' Mei Xiang has had numerous pseudo-pregnancies in the past and in a decade has produced one cub, Tai Shan. The disappointment comes after the departure in February of the zoo's giant panda favorite, Tai Shan, who was born there in 2005. Tai Shan was sent to join a breeding program in China. In addition, the zoo faces the possibility that Mei Xiang and her mate, Tian Tian, may also soon depart. The adult giant pandas are here on a 10-year lease from China that expires in December. ",1

4,"In an effort to protect the military's computer networks, the Obama administration is planning to put the leader of the nation's largest electronic spying agency in charge of a new military organization capable of launching attacks against enemy networks and power grids. If confirmed by Senate, Lt. Gen. Keith Alexander, director of the National Security Agency, would take charge of the Pentagon's newly formed cyber command and preside over a virtual army of computer technicians and network warfare specialists. But even as the Obama administration presses the importance of cybersecurity and hails its nominee as an aggressive and innovative military intelligence officer, Alexander's confirmation has been delayed for nearly six months. Lawmakers have questioned whether the head of the NSA should lead a military unit and what, exactly, that new unit will be empowered to do. Alexander is set to testify before the Senate Armed Services Committee on Thursday but has already provided written responses to questions from lawmakers. Among other things, he stated that, faced with a cyber attack, the military must be able to respond in kind. It is 'reasonable to assume that returning fire in cyberspace' is lawful, as long as any actions comply with the laws of war, he said in a 32-page document. At issue is how military and intelligence authorities guide the operations of any new cyber command. U.S. policies governing cyber attacks and counterattacks lag behind the military's ability to conduct them. Part of the challenge is that in cyberspace, a line of computer code could be an attempt to spy, disrupt a network or defend it, and that same code might unintentionally knock out critical systems in countries far from the target. The ambiguity _ and the fact that there is no international consensus on what constitutes use of force in cyberspace _ means the risks of provoking international conflict are real, experts say. Any offensive cyber action must be guided by orders from the secretary of defense and approved by the president, a senior defense official said. He 'can't simply get up one morning and say, `I want to go attack something,' ' the official said. In his written responses, Alexander said that clandestine, offensive actions in cyberspace _ such as dismantling a Web site used by jihadists overseas _ are 'traditional military activities' and should not be considered covert operations. In the event of a cyber attack, the military must still be able to carry out conventional operations. 'Even with the clear understanding that we could experience damage to our infrastructure, we must be prepared to `fight through' in the worst case scenario,' he said. The Justice Department and policymakers are still grappling with the legal and policy boundaries inherent in cyberwarfare, and their decisions may well affect the scope of the command's offensive operations. 'The real problem here has been with the Pentagon and the White House, who have to come up with the cyber command strategy,' said Richard Clarke, a cybersecurity adviser to President George W. Bush and the author of a forthcoming book, 'Cyber War.' In his answers, Alexander makes clear that though the cyber command's focus is on military networks, it will be prepared to 'provide military options' to the president if attacks on private, critical computer systems and civilian government systems threaten the nation's security. He made clear that the military command, not the Department of Homeland Security, would take the 'lead role' in responding to a cyber attack on the United States, but under a presidential order. There are often competing demands between intelligence agencies, which want to obtain information, and the military, which wants to save lives and win wars. In military cyberspace, Alexander said, he would be the 'focal point' for deciding whose interest should prevail in a disagreement. Some intelligence officials are concerned that the launching of a cyber command will draw away NSA resources that might otherwise support the collection of national strategic intelligence. But Alexander, 58, has supporters who say he's up to the task. They also say he's able to make complex technical subjects clear to lay people, including lawmakers. A graduate of West Point, Alexander has masters' degrees in electronic warfare, physics and national security. He already heads an offensive cyber organization, the Joint Functional Component Command-Network Warfare, a body that will be merged into a new cyber command. 'He is a `techie,' but also a communicator,' said NSA Deputy Director Chris Inglis. 'He is the right man in the right position at the right time.' As NSA director, Alexander has focused on delivering intelligence to the battlefield. In August 2005, he wanted to speed the harvesting of raw signals intelligence. He wanted a soldier in, say, Fallujah, Iraq, to be able to type in a name or phrase on a laptop-like device, as in a Google search, and in seconds pull up relevant information. He gave NSA developers 90 days to build a prototype. He called it Real Time 10, or Real Time to the 10th power, to emphasize speed. 'The (signals intelligence) may reveal an insurgent who's getting ready to detonate an IED or ambush a unit,' said Collin Agee, an intelligence official who saw RT 10 at work in Iraq. 'The whole point was to compress the timeline.' Senior military officials, including the secretary of defense, praised the NSA's contributions. At the same time, said a former intelligence official, Alexander 'drove the system nuts' by his insistence on in-house, rapid development of RT 10. Critics said Alexander rushed the process and failed to take appropriate procedural measures. A report by the NSA's inspector general concluded no rules had been broken. But questions about the episode have nonetheless contributed to the delay in the confirmation process, said current and former intelligence officials. Supporters say Alexander's emphasis on tactical intelligence has not given strategic intelligence short shrift. Toward the end of the Bush administration, the NSA undertook a major revision of collection priorities, a controversial process that meant some intelligence needs of some agencies would be given less urgency. The State Department asked Alexander and Inglis, his deputy, to reconsider some strategic priorities. 'They heard us out' and made adjustments, a former senior department official recalled. -0-< Staff researcher Julie Tate contributed to this report. ",3
4,"The angry faces at Tea Party rallies are eerily familiar. They resemble faces of protesters lining the street at the University of Alabama in 1956 as Autherine Lucy, the school's first black student, bravely tried to walk to class. Those same jeering faces could be seen gathered around the Arkansas National Guard troopers who blocked nine black children from entering Little Rock's Central High School in 1957. 'They moved closer and closer,' recalled Elizabeth Eckford, one of the Little Rock Nine. 'Somebody started yelling, `Lynch her! Lynch her!' I tried to see a friendly face somewhere in the crowd _ someone who maybe could help. I looked into the face of an old woman and it seemed a kind face, but when I looked at her again, she spat on me.' Those were the faces I saw at a David Duke rally in Metairie, La., in 1991: sullen with resentment, wallowing in victimhood, then exploding with yells of excitement as the ex-Klansman and Republican gubernatorial candidate spewed vitriolic white-power rhetoric. People like that old woman in Little Rock, the Alabama mob that hounded Autherine Lucy, the embracers of Duke's demagoguery in Louisiana, never go away. They were spotted last weekend on Capitol Hill under the Tea Party banner protesting the health-care-reform bill. Some carried a signs that read 'If Brown (Scott Brown, R-Mass., ) can't stop it, a Browning (high power weapon) can.' Some shouted racial and homophobic epithets at members of Congress. Others assumed the role of rabble, responding to the calls of instigating Republican representatives gathered on a Capitol balcony. Tea Party members, as with their forerunners who showed up at the University of Alabama and Central High School, behave as they do because they have been culturally conditioned to believe they are entitled to do whatever they want, and to whomever they want, because they are the 'real Americans,' while all who don't think or look like them are not. And they are consequential. Without folks like them, there would be no Rush Limbaugh, Glenn Beck, Sean Hannity or Pat Buchanan. There would never have been a George Corley Wallace, the Alabama governor dubbed by Pulitzer Prize-winning author Diane McWhorter in a 2008 Slate article as 'the godfather, avatar of a national uprising against the three G's of government, Godlessness, and gun control.' Hence, an explanation for the familiarity of faces: today's Tea Party adherents are George Wallace legacies. They, like Wallace's followers, smolder with anger. They fear they are being driven from their rightful place in America. They see the world through the eyes of the anti-civil rights alumni. 'Washington, D.C.' now, as then, is regarded as the Great Satan. This is the place that created the civil rights laws that were shoved down their throats. This is the birthplace of their much-feared 'Big Government' and the playground of the 'elite national news media.' And they are faithful to the old Wallace playbook. McWhorter wrote how Wallace, in a 1963 speech to the political arm of Alabama's Ku Klux Klan, 'referred to the recent bombings in Birmingham against prominent black citizens, citing the lack of fatalities as proof that the `nigras' were throwing the dynamite themselves in order to attract publicity and money.' Fast-forward to today. Note the pro-Tea Party conservative commentary debunking last weekend's racist and homophobic slurs as a work of fiction and exaggeration strictly for political reasons.Noticeable, too, is the influence of George Wallace, Limbaugh, Beck and their followers on outcomes. The angry '50s and '60s crowds threatened and intimidated; some among them even murdered. That notwithstanding, Americans of goodwill gathered in the White House to witness the signing of landmark civil rights laws. Schoolhouse doors were blocked, and little children were demeaned. Yet the bigots didn't get the last word. Justice rolled down like a mighty river, sweeping them aside. They insulted, abused, lied and vandalized. Still, President Obama fulfilled his promise to sign historic health-care reform into law by the end of his first term. Those angry faces won't go away. But neither can they stand in the way of progress. The mobs of yesteryear were on the wrong side of history. Tea Party supporters and their right-wing fellow travelers are on the wrong side now. It shows up in their faces. _ _ _ Colbert I . King writes a weekly column for The Washington Post. ",3

4,"Go ahead. It's okay to laugh at al-Qaida. It's okay to call Umar Farouk Abdulmutallab the Underbomber, or even the Tighty- Whitey Terrorist. It's okay to call his explosive-bearing undergarment the Jihad Jockeys or the Frighty Whities or Fruit of the Boom. It's okay to laugh about the 'wardrobe malfunction' that kept the bomb in his pants from going off in a plane over Detroit, and about the likelihood that even if the underpants bomb had exploded, there would be '72 very disappointed virgins' when the martyr got to heaven. It is probably even okay to put a photo of the terrorist's singed briefs on the cover of the New York Post with the headlines 'GREAT BALLS OF FIRE' and 'Blast Packing Undies are the Real Hot Pants.' This is all okay because, for all the hand-wringing and finger-pointing surrounding the failed Christmas Day attack, the real lesson of the botched bombing is a happy one: If this is the worst al- Qaida can do, we're in good shape. Yes, it's bad that U.S. authorities missed all the red flags and let Abdulmutallab get so close to success. And it would have been really, really bad if he had blown up the plane. But the dismay of the past two weeks misses a larger point: that the nature of the attack shows just how lame al-Qaida really is. Eight years ago, most experts were convinced that the terrorists would have hit us with a dirty bomb by now. Dirty underpants just aren't as menacing. Remember some of these Post headlines in the months after the Sept. 11 attacks? 'Fears Prompt U.S. to Beef Up Nuclear Terror Detection; Sensors Deployed Near D.C., Borders; Delta Force on Standby'; 'U.S. Fears Bin Laden Made Nuclear Strides; Concern Over `Dirty Bomb' Affects Security'; 'Shadow Government Is at Work in Secret; After Attacks, Bush Ordered 100 Officials to Bunkers Away From Capital to Ensure Federal Survival'; 'Terrorist Attacks Imminent, FBI Warns; ... Assaults on U.S. Called Possible in `Next Several Days' '; 'Al-Qaida May Have Crude Chemical, Germ Capabilities.' But instead of WMD, we got BVDs. 'Blowing up an individual plane is terrible, but it's nothing compared to the catastrophic terrorism risk that most of us feared we'd see soon after 9/11,' said Joe Cirincione, an expert on nuclear terrorism who is president of the Ploughshares Fund. 'We figured there would be a huge escalation in the terrorist attacks.' What emerged instead, he added, was 'one crazy 23-year-old kid with plastic explosives _ this is not the kind of sophisticated attack you'd need to do something like a nuclear weapon.' In part, we overestimated (or, in the case of the Bush administration, perhaps exaggerated) the threat from al-Qaida. In part, the post-Sept. 11 efforts to strengthen the borders and disrupt terrorist operations have worked. Whatever the cause, al-Qaida is now less an organization than a bunch of loosely affiliated cells. These cells are capable of inflicting plenty of pain, as a suicide bomber's killing of seven Americans at a CIA base in Afghanistan last month reminded us. But they do not pose an existential threat to the United States. They can put a kid on a plane with plastic explosives in his pants, but they still can't destroy a U.S. city with loose nukes. This isn't a reason to declare victory or to pull back from the fight, but it is cause to be thankful that things aren't as bad as we thought they'd be. Keeping al-Qaida to this level of 'nuisance' terrorism should be the goal. Attacks by small, uncoordinated cells are harder to prevent, but they aren't as devastating. In the war on terrorism, limiting the enemy to his Frighty Whities is about the best we can hope for. Certainly, the Obama administration should patch the holes in aviation security and fix the newly uncovered gaps in intelligence. But it's more important to redirect some of this frenzy over the underwear bomb to where it really matters: keeping nuclear materials away from terrorists. The president has pledged to do this, and he's gathering some 40 heads of state in Washington in April for the Nuclear Security Summit. Their goal should be to secure remaining nuclear material before al-Qaida and al-Qaida-like groups can get to it, and to end the civilian use of highly enriched uranium. If they can do that _ and that's a big 'if' _ al-Qaida really will be nothing more than Fruit-of-the-Loom fanatics. And the joke will be on them. ",3
4,"Recently, I happened to hear the latest segment in NPR's ongoing series '50 great voices,' this one honoring a singer I'd never heard of, Esma Redzepova. The series has cast its net laudably wide; I realized that, opera lover though I am, I was a lot happier to learn about Redzepova, a world-famous Yugoslavian vocal star, than to hear one more segment extolling some opera singer I already loved (so far, Maria Callas is the only opera singer the series has featured). Redzepova has a voice that sounds like a beat-up Mustang barreling along a street full of potholes: it's gamey and battered and tough and it's been places and it's going more places and it doesn't really care what's in its way. I was particularly struck by the story of the years of training she put in to get it that way. She's 64 now and still performing actively, so you'd better believe she knows what she's doing. To back this up she told the kind of maybe- apocryphal story that's a part of every great singer's legend, about practicing for two years four hours a day, five days a week (I find it particularly endearing that she took weekends off), to elevate her voice from pretty and ineffectual to the sustained force it is today. I wish every classical singer would listen to this segment for the lessons it has to teach about the meaning of technique. Technique isn't just something that refines your voice into a polished, finished, pretty product, although too many singers and teachers do approach it that way. Technique, for Redzepova, was about blowing the whole instrument open, turning it into a powerhouse that could sustain heavy use without damage. Technique is something sturdy. It enables you to dig in and get some use out of your instrument. This is just as true of opera singers as of the so-called 'Queen of the Gypsies.' I don't mean that opera singers want to sound like Redzepova, but I do mean that most of the great classical singers have had this kind of solid technique, a voice that can stand up to some wear and tear and still sound glorious after a few decades: think Flagstad, Melchior or Sutherland. I also wish that opera, today, could win back some of the visceral appeal that Redzepova demonstrates. Not everyone is going to like the way she sounds, but I think nearly anyone who hears her can tell what she's trying to do and whether she's doing it well. Opera, by contrast, seems so artificial to so many people that non-aficionados often respond by simply being impressed by the volume. I've written before about attending rehearsals with young singers and seeing people giving signs of being tremendously impressed about singing that was uncertain, out of tune, without rhythmic integrity. These same people would never tolerate such singing in another musical genre, but when it comes to opera, they presume they don't understand it well enough to judge it, and simply overlook anything that sounds bad, as if it must be part of the convention. I think if more singers today dug in and let loose with Redzepova's brand of direct honesty it would be a lot easier to overcome the widespread sense of 'otherness' in opera, reach out more directly to new listeners, and restore the visceral thrill that, at its best, the genre is about. - 0 - Midgette, Washington Post classical music critic, writes the 'Classical Beat' blog on washingtonpost.com, from which this article is adapted.

The details were included in a document that Obama administration sent to U.S. lawmakers.

The document says the facility is 'too small to be viable for the production of fuel for a nuclear power reactor, but may be well suited for a military purpose.'

4,"The doctor whose research linking autism and the vaccine for measles, mumps and rubella influenced millions of parents to refuse the shot for their children was banned Monday from practicing medicine in his native Britain. Dr. Andrew Wakefield's 1998 study was discredited -- but vaccination rates have never fully recovered and he continues to enjoy a vocal following, helped in the U.S. by endorsements from celebrities like Jim Carrey and Jenny McCarthy Wakefield was the first researcher to publish a peer-reviewed study suggesting a connection between autism and the vaccine for measles, mumps and rubella. Legions of parents abandoned the vaccine, leading to a resurgence of measles in Western countries where it had been mostly stamped out. There are outbreaks across Europe every year and sporadic outbreaks in the U.S. 'That is Andrew Wakefield's legacy,' said Paul Offit, chief of infectious diseases at the Children's Hospital of Philadelphia. 'The hospitalizations and deaths of children from measles who could have easily avoided the disease.' Wakefield's discredited theories had a tremendous impact in the U.S., Offit said, adding: 'He gave heft to the notion that vaccines in general cause autism.' In Britain, Wakefield's research led to a huge decline in the number of children receiving the MMR vaccine: from 95 percent in 1995 -- enough to prevent measles outbreaks -- to 50 percent in parts of London in the early 2000s. Rates have begun to recover, though not enough to prevent outbreaks. In 2006, a 13-year-old boy became the first person to die from measles in Britain in 14 years. 'The false suggestion of a link between autism and the MMR vaccine has done untold damage to the UK vaccination program,' said Terence Stephenson, president of the Royal College of Paediatrics and Child Health. 'Overwhelming scientific evidence shows that it is safe.' On Monday, Britain's General Medical Council, which licenses and oversees doctors, found Wakefield guilty of serious professional misconduct and stripped him of the right to practice medicine in the U.K. Wakefield said he plans to appeal the ruling, which takes effect within 28 days. The council was acting on a finding in January that Wakefield and two other doctors showed a 'callous disregard' for the children in their study, published in 1998 in the medical journal Lancet. The medical body said Wakefield took blood samples from children at his son's birthday party, paying them 5 pounds (about $7.20) each and later joked about the incident. The study has since been widely rejected. From 1998-2004, studies in journals including the Lancet, the New England Journal of Medicine, Pediatrics and BMJ published papers showing no link between autism and the measles vaccine. Wakefield moved to the U.S. in 2004 and set up an autism research center in Austin, Texas, where he gained a wide following despite being unlicensed as a doctor there and facing skepticism from the medical community. He quit earlier this year. Offit said he doubted Britain's decision to strip the 53-year-old Wakefield of his medical license would convince many parents that vaccines are safe. 'He's become almost like a Christ-like figure and it doesn't matter that science has proven him wrong,' Offit said. 'He is a hero for parents who think no one else is listening to them.' Wakefield told The Associated Press Monday's decision was a sad day for British medicine. 'None of this alters the fact that vaccines can cause autism,' he said. 'These parents are not going away; the children are not going to go away and I most certainly am not going away,' he said on NBC's 'Today Show.' Wakefield claimed the U.S. government has been settling cases of vaccine-induced autism since 1991. However, two rulings by a special branch of the U.S. Court of Federal Claims in March and last year found no link between vaccines and autism. More than 5,500 claims have been filed by families seeking compensation for children they claim were hurt by the vaccine. Wakefield has won support from parents suspicious of vaccines, including Hollywood celebrities. McCarthy, who has an autistic son, issued a statement in February with then boyfriend Carrey asserting Wakefield was 'being vilified through a well-orchestrated smear campaign.' 'It is our most sincere belief that Dr. Wakefield and parents of children with autism around the world are being subjected to a remarkable media campaign engineered by vaccine manufacturers,' the actors said. McCarthy, whose best-seller 'Louder Than Words' details her search for treatments for her son Evan, wrote the foreword for a new book by Wakefield about autism and vaccines. In Monday's ruling, the medical council said Wakefield abused his position as a doctor and 'brought the medical profession into disrepute.' At the time of his study, Wakefield was working as a gastroenterologist at London's Royal Free Hospital and did not have approval for the research. The study suggested autistic children had a bowel disease and raised the possibility of a link between autism and vaccines. He had also been paid to advise lawyers representing parents who believed their children had been hurt by the MMR vaccine. Ten of the study's authors later renounced its conclusions and it was retracted by the Lancet in February. At least a dozen British medical associations, including the Royal College of Physicians, the Medical Research Council and the Wellcome Trust have issued statements verifying the safety of the measles, mumps and rubella vaccine. This verdict is not about (the measles) vaccine,' said Adam Finn, a professor of pediatrics at the University of Bristol Medical School. 'We all now know that the vaccine is remarkably safe and enormously effective... We badly need to put this right for the sake of our own children and children worldwide.' ------ Associated Press Writer Kelley Shannon contributed to this report from Austin, Texas. ------ Online: Ruling on Wakefield, http://www.gmc-uk.org/Wakefield--SPM--and(un ers core)SANCTION.pdf(underscore)32595267.pdf ",3
4,"Christmas is upon us, and for a top ballerina at New York City Ballet, that means one sure thing: suiting up in tulle and sequins as the Sugarplum Fairy in the annual classic, 'The Nutcracker.' What Jenifer Ringer surely didn't expect was to be accused of having 'eaten one sugarplum too many.' That remark two weeks ago by America's most prominent dance critic reverberated across the Web, with many coming to Ringer's defense and calling the reviewer a cad. Even worse, angry fans wrote on chat boards, Ringer has been public about struggles with eating disorders earlier in her career, over which she triumphed to become one of NYCB's most popular dancers. How cruel, then, to criticize her body now. Through two weeks of chatter, though, Ringer remained publicly silent, as most dancers do -- until Monday, when she appeared on NBC's 'Today' to address the controversy swirling around her like the confetti in 'Nutcracker's' famous snowflake scene. 'I'm not overweight,' said the ballerina, who at 37 is not only a company veteran but one of only three mothers in its ranks. 'I do have, I guess, a more womanly type than the stereotypical ballerina.' But she declined to demand an apology from New York Times dance critic Alastair Macaulay. 'It's his opinion,' said Ringer, whom NYCB would not make available to The Associated Press for comment. 'He is a critic and he's paid to put his opinion in the paper.' She added that 'there were 2,000 people probably out there ... and everyone else had a different opinion as well.' Amid the kerfuffle over whether and when a dancer's weight becomes an issue lies an even more basic question about ballet, an art form in which the body is subjected to untold rigors -- not to mention the constant threat of injury -- in order to fulfill its strict, time-honored requirements. Are different body types allowed? Must one be rail-thin to qualify as a top dancer? To longtime observer Wendy Perron, editor of Dance Magazine, the answer is no. 'Perhaps she is not the thinnest dancer on the stage, but who cares?' Perron said in an interview. 'What she has is warmth. She is just wonderful in the role of the Sugarplum Fairy, welcoming Marie and her prince to the Land of the Sweets. Not every dancer can pull that off.' Indeed, one imagines that Ringer's proficiency in the role is what led NYCB head Peter Martins to cast her in the opening night of 'Nutcracker' this season, one of only two performances to which critics are invited. (Martins, too, was unavailable for comment.) Yet Macaulay wrote: 'This didn't feel, however, like an opening night. Jenifer Ringer, as the Sugar Plum Fairy, looked as if she'd eaten one sugar plum too many; and Jared Angle, as the Cavalier, seems to have been sampling half the Sweet realm.' Interestingly, the criticism of Angle has not drawn nearly as much attention. Nor has Macaulay's other comment about the couple, that they lacked 'adult depth and complexity.' But fans thought there was something particularly cruel about the weight comment, probably because body type is one thing, as NYCB principal dancer Wendy Whelan puts it, that you can't do anything about. 'It's just unfair when somebody criticizes a part of you that you can't change,' said Whelan, also one of the company's most popular and admired dancers, in a phone interview. 'Jenifer has always looked like that. I think she's absolutely gorgeous! She's one of my favorite dancers in the world. And when I watch her dance, my eye doesn't see anything wrong with it.' The New York Times said Macaulay was not available for comment, and that a critic's reviews stand for themselves. Macaulay did publish a follow-up column to answer criticism of his comments on Ringer several days later. Noting that one reader had called his review appalling, heartbreaking, childish, hurtful and incompetent all at once, he wrote: 'If you want to make your appearance irrelevant to criticism, do not choose ballet as a career. The body in ballet becomes a subject of the keenest observation and the most intense discussion. I am severe -- but ballet, as dancers know, is more so.' That position did not sit well with many -- especially those who are familiar with eating disorders. 'His comment was just below the belt,' said Dr. Katharine Halmi, a specialist in eating disorders at Weill Cornell Medical College. 'It's well established that dancers are at a tremendous risk for eating disorders. Ballet companies are just now dealing with it. So this is really bad.' As Ringer herself pointed out, one of the things many people admire about NYCB is that it celebrates different body types. 'We have every body type you can imagine,' she said on 'Today.' 'We have tall, we have petite, we have athletic, we have womanly, we have waif-like, we have every body type out there, and they can all dance like crazy and they're all gorgeous.' ",1
4,"At some recent point, bacon became a meme. (ital) Bacon. (end ital) The cured pork product that has been a staple food for hundreds of years was suddenly a fashion accessory for Internet style-mongers. There were odes and T-shirts and cartoons. People taped bacon to their cats and took photos. It was so ubiquitous that I started to hate bacon. No one should ever have to hate bacon. What used to be an amusing byproduct of Internet use has mutated into something horrible: an insatiable parasite that impairs its host's judgment, rendering it totally useless. Instead of acting as an organic cultural touchstone, the modern meme _ from LOL, which hasn't been used to signify physical laughter since 1997, to Lolcats _ now sucks the joy out of our interconnectedness. It destroys uniqueness. Once an 'enjoyable thing' becomes a 'meme,' we stop enjoying the thing for its own sake, but consume and regurgitate our enjoyment of it as a symbol of hipness, as if to say: 'I am aware of this thing's popularity _ therefore I, too, exist!' But the short life span of the average meme means it can't imprint itself on the human psyche in any real way. We want instant nostalgia, and what we get is manufactured zeitgeist. The faster memes spread, the more homogenized online conversation becomes, until a few phrases dominate the discourse. (And if you've never had the unfortunate occasion to hear someone, forgetting that life is not a message board, yell 'FAIL!' aloud, you are missing out on an exquisite kind of existential rage.) Life on the Internet moves too fast. There's no time to let experience meet friction, or to absorb and truly reconstitute information. So slow down, breathe, and appreciate what's real in life. _ Randazzo is the editor of the Onion and the founder of the Joe Randazzo Association. ",1
