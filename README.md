# LUN News Classification - CS4248 Project
## CS4248 Group 39 - AY23/24 Sem 2

Welcome to the repository for Group 39's project for CS4248. Our project focuses on classifying the reliability of news documents.

### Project Description

In this project, we aim to predict the reliability of news documents using a 4-way classification model. The labels for classification are as follows:
- 1: "Satire"
- 2: "Hoax"
- 3: "Propaganda"
- 4: "Reliable News"

Our objective is to train a model that can accurately distinguish between these types of news, helping users better understand the trustworthiness of the information they consume.
